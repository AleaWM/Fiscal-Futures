We do not include escrow or principal payments.\n\n\\*\\*Decision from Sept 30 2022:\\*\\* We are no longer including short term principal payments as a cost; only interest on borrowing is a cost. Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an escrow payment and principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as revenues. This caused expenditures to be inflated because we were essentially counting debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the money was spent on in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect.\n\n**Objects:**\n\n8813 interest \\*\\*INCLUDE AS COST\\*\\*\n\n8811 is for principle \\*\\*EXCLUDE from aggregate debt expenditure\\*\\*\n\n8841 is for escrow payments \\*\\*EXCLUDE from aggregate debt expenditure\\*\\*\n\n8800 is for capital projects debt service (e.g. Build Illinois Bonds, Civic Center, Tollway \\*\\*EXCLUDE tollway in debt cost\\*\\*\n\n-   Note: debt principle and interest are both included in capital projects because they are combined in the data observations; bond proceeds are not considered a revenue source. Can't include capital projects interest as easily as the GO bonds.\n\n\\*\\*Obj_seq_type:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Exclude: Bond principle payments: obj_seq_type == 88110008\n\n\\- Exclude: Short term borrowing principle: obj_seq_type == 88110108\n\n\\- Include: General Obligation Bond Interest: obj_seq_type == 88130000 & 88130008\n\n\\- Include: Interest on short-term borrowing: 88130108\n\n\\- Exclude: Escrow payment == 88410008\n\n\\- Include: Build IL Bonds, capital projects principal AND interest\n\n-   Tollway is obj_seq_type == 88000055, filter out fund == 0455 to remove tollway\n\n-   fund == 0455 is the IL State Toll Highway fund, items mostly for operations and maintenance\n\n#### Tollway Debt, Revenue, and Expenditures\n\n```{r tollway}\n\ntollway <- exp_temp %>% filter(fund == \"0455\") #all tollway expenditures\n\ncapitalproject_debtservice <- exp_temp %>%filter(object == \"8800\") # ALL Capital projects debt service\n\n# look at Illinois tollway bond proceeds and debt service: \n\n# rev_temp %>% filter(fund == \"0455\") # examine items in fund 0455\n\n#exp_temp %>% filter(fund == \"0455\") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(sum = sum(expenditure)) %>% arrange(-fy)\n\ntollway\n\n#rev_temp %>% filter(fund == \"0455\") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(sum = sum(receipts)) %>% arrange(-fy)\n\ntollway_exp <- exp_temp %>% filter(fund == \"0455\") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(expenditure = sum(expenditure))\n\n                                                                                                    #tollway_exp %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=expenditure)) + labs(title = \"Fund 0455 from Expenditure: All Tollway Expenditures\", caption = \"Data from IOC Expenditure Files.
