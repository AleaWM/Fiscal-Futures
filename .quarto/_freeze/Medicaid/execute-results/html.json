The FMAP formula compares the state per-capita income to the national per-capita income. There is no cap on the dollar amount that the federal government pays, so the morethat a state spends the more that it receives. a maximum of 83%. States with a higher per-capita income receive lower FMAP funding but no less than 50%, and the states that have a lower per-capita income receive higher FMAP funding. Those that need more, get more.\n",
