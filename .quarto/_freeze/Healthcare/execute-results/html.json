Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an expenditure in our analysis.\n\nFunding for the State Employees Group Insurance plan originates from two funds. The Health Insurance Reserve Fund (HIRF) and the Group Insurance Premium Fund (GIPF). Contributions and payment for Health coverage benefits are deposited INTO HIRF and contributions for life insurance are deposited into the GIPF.\n\nHIRF is the fund mainly used to administer the group insurance program. Funding for HIRF comes from several different revenue sources, the General Revenue Fund (GRF), Road Fund, reimbursements, university funds, and misc funds. [CGFA Report](https://cgfa.ilga.gov/Upload/fy2011stateemployees'groupinsurance.pdf).\n\n**Coding details**\n\nIn FY2013, the Local Government Health Insurance fund was transferred to the department of Central Management Services (agency changes from 478 to 416 in data.)\n\nEmployer group insurance contributions for health insurance are excluded to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare provision. All employer group insurance contributions are coded as object = 1180. BUT the last two fiscal years were coded as 1900 instead of 1180 for lump sums instead of employer contributions --- anything to do with pandemic money categorization?\n\n-   Fund = 0907 = health insurance reserve, in_ff = 1\n-   Fund = 0457 is \"Group insurance premium\", in_ff = 1\n-   Fund = 0193 is \"Local govt health insurance reserve\", in=ff = 0\n-   fund = 0477 is \"Community College Health Insurance\", in=ff = 0.\n    -   had large amount in early years\n-   Fund = 9939 is \"group self-insurers' insolv\", in_ff = 1\n-   Fund = 0940 is Self-Insurers security, in_ff = 0\n-   Fund = 0739 is Group Workers Comp Pool Insol, in_ff = 1\n    -   eehc = 0 means it is NOT a state healthcare cost but it is an employer contribution of some type to some fund\n\n    -   eehc = 1 means it is a state employee healthcare cost and it is an employer contribution to health insurance\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp_temp <- read_csv(\"exp_temp.csv\")\nrev_temp <- read_csv(\"rev_temp.csv\")\n\n\nhealth_ins_reserve <- exp_temp %>% filter(fund == \"0907\") %>%  group_by(fy) %>% \n\n    summarize(fund_0907 = sum(expenditure)) \n\nhealth_ins_reserve %>% \n\n  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=fund_0907)) + geom_line() + labs(title=\"Health Insurance Reserve\", subtitle = \"Sum of expenditures from fund 907\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Healthcare_files/figure-html/healthcare-employer-contributions-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# object 1180 is inconsistently coded over time form the IOC \n\n# object 1180 should be employer contributions to healthcare group insurance\n\nemployer_contributions <- exp_temp %>% filter(object == \"1180\") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(object1180 = sum(expenditure)) \n\nemployer_contributions%>% \n\n  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=object1180)) + geom_line() + labs(title=\"Employer Contributions to Healthcare Group Insurance, IOC Object 1180\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Healthcare_files/figure-html/healthcare-employer-contributions-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nemployer_contributions2 <- exp_temp %>% filter(object == \"1180\" & fund==\"0001\") %>% group_by(fy) %>% summarize(object1180 = sum(expenditure)) \n\nemployer_contributions2 %>% \n\n  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=object1180)) + geom_line() + labs(title=\"Employer Contributions to Healthcare Group Insurance\", subtitle = \"IOC Object 1180 from Fund 001\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Healthcare_files/figure-html/healthcare-employer-contributions-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# examine combined group insurance totals per year\n\ngroup_ins2 <- exp_temp %>% \n\n  mutate(eehc = ifelse(\n\n    # group insurance contributions for 1998-2005 and 2013-present\n\n    # CMS took over health insurance in 2013\n\n   fund == \"0001\" & (object == \"1180\" | object ==\"1900\") & agency == \"416\" & appr_org==\"20\", 1, 0) )%>% \n\n  mutate(eehc = ifelse(\n\n    # group insurance contributions for 2006-2012\n\n    # health insurance was in healthcare and family services, agency 478 for a few years\n\n    fund == \"0001\" & object == \"1180\" & agency == \"478\" & appr_org==\"80\", 1, eehc) )%>%\n\n  filter(eehc == 1) %>% \n\n    group_by(fy) %>% \n\n    summarize(dropped_group_premiums = sum(expenditure, na.rm=TRUE))\n\ngroup_ins2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=dropped_group_premiums)) + geom_line() + labs(title=\"Employer Healthcare Group Insurance Contributions\", subtitle= \" - Dropped from analysis to avoid double counting healthcare expenditures\", caption = \"Objects 1180 and 1900 from fund 0001.
