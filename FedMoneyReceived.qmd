Dropping revenue source "Federal Stimulus Package" from the IOC revenue data is one way to start estimating how revenue will look after the COVID relief ends. The graphs below show Illinois revenue with and without Federal Stimulus Package revenue. It is important to note that only the \$8.127 ARPA State CURE and \$3.519 CARES CRF/State CURE revenue were labeled as "Federal Stimulus Package" in the IOC revenue data. There was still an additional \$12 billion dollars in other federal revenue that went to the state in FY22 compared to FY19. When trying to understand the states finances and the yearly fiscal gap, we also need to understand when and where the funds were considered revenue in the IOC data and consider the fiscal year that the funds were spent. Finally, allocations or expenditures may be grouped and labeled differently by the State compared to the Fiscal Futures project categorization. Some items that the federal relief funds are spent on are not included in Fiscal Gap calculations (e.g. the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund repayments). The biggest challenge when determining the Fiscal Gap for Illinois centers around the timing of revenue and expenditures occurring in different fiscal years during the COVID response.

## COVID Money Tracker Data

Read the charts from the top to the bottom. Most of the graphs below begin with either the year the money was committed or the name of the Law that provided the funds and then shows it flowing down to either who received the money or how it was spent.

Data was downloaded from COVIDMoneyTracker.org for the State of Illinois. Values reflect the amount committed and not all funds have been disbursed yet. It does not include aid for households or loans to businesses. Data file is named federalcoviddollars.xlsx in Github page used to create this website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The graphs below focus on when the money from each Federal Act arrived and where it was received (local governments, the State government, or directly to a state department) and the spending category that it would be considered using the Fiscal Futures categorization. The State government received \$11.7 billion, state departments received \$31.4 billion, and local governments received \$8.9 billion between FY 2020 and FY 2022. Not all funds have been distributed by the federal government, but they have been committed on the federal level and allocated on the state level.

Local Governments within Illinois received an additional \$8.9 billion for economic recovery but we do not include funds given straight to localities in our State COVID recovery fund calculations or Fiscal Gap analysis.

Legislation total funds (when including local government aid) were: ARPA = \$25.6 Billion; CARES = \$15.7 Billion; Families First = \$4.5 Billion; PPP & Health Care = \$2.8 Billion; Response & Relief = \$3.4 Billion.

Illinois received \$11.7 billion dollars from State Fiscal Recovery Funds and \$31.4 billion in other federal revenue to state departments. This other federal revenue frequently came in the form of increased or new grants to many State Departments that normally receive federal funding.

#### Totals Without Local Government Funds

Below is a graph showing federal stimulus money that was received in each year, the federal agency/fund that it came from, and what kind of revenue it was considered (Federal Other, transportation, or medicaid) who received the money (e.g. the State of Illinois, Department of Human Services, Local Governments, etc.). Again, these graphs show the funds that were received and their intended purpose, NOT the data on how or when it was spent.

When Local Funds are included, \$15.7 billion was received in FY20, \$7.24 billion in FY21, and \$29 billion was received in FY22 from multiple COVID response Federal Acts.

Around \$43 billion went to the state and \$8.8 billion went to straight to local governments. When excluding the money that went straight to local governments, the state received \$12.7 billion in FY20 (CARES Act), \$7.24 billion in FY21, and \$23 billion was committed in FY22 (ARP Act). This includes both State CURE funds that had more flexibility in how they were spent as well as the grants and that went to State Departments for specific purposes.

The code below creates same graph as above but funds that went straight to Local Governments (cities and counties) are dropped from the totals.

## State Expenditure Graphs

Federal expenditures from CURE and other major funds . Uses the `fedCUREexpenditures.xlsx` file.

This data comes from Illinois Comptroller expenditure data, Legislative Budget Oversight Commission (LBOC) Reports, and the [ARPA Annual Recovery Plan](https://budget.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/budget/documents/arpa/IL%20Recovery%20Plan%20Performance%20Report%202022.pdf) detailing the State's use of State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) which is prepared by the Governor's Office of Management and Budget (GOMB).

The graphs below do not include FY23 allocations for federal funds. Dates on top are Fiscal Year received. Dates in the middle of the graph are Fiscal Year expenditures. Remember, federal funds for COVID recovery have been received and spent in different years.

Between FY20 and FY22, 12.2 billion in State CURE and ESSER funds hav been spent by the state.

So far, over \$7.6 billion of the State CURE funds (from CARES and ARP Act) have been spent. In FY22, \$4.9 billion ARPA dollars were spent

Major uses of the State CURE funds include \$2.7 billion for repaying the unemployment insurance trust fund deficit, \$1 billion was transferred to general revenue to make up for lost revenue during the pandemic, \$2.34 billion has gone towards economic development and recovery, \$1.87 billion to human services, \$1.9 billion to K-12 education.

### State CURE Expenditures with FY2023 and beyond allocations

Graphs below include how money has been spent in FY21 and FY22 with unspent funds labeled as `FY2023+`.

This image focuses on only the funds that came through the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund and a couple additional funds that came through different agencies but were received by the State of Illinois. Other Federal Revenue largely indicates the ESSER funds that were received by ISBE and were spent on K-12 education.

-   \$3.54 Billion received in FY20 for State Fiscal Recovery Fund (SFRF)+ \$11.8 billion received in FY22 = \$15.3 billion total expenditures and allocations included in this image.

-   Around \$10.8 billion has gone into the State CURE fund (Cornavirus Relief Funds (CRF) and SFRF into the State CURE fund) and another \$4.5 billion was received by State Departments (mostly ISBE for K-12 )

-   So far, over \$13 billion has been spent.

    -   \$2.7 billion was spent in FY21 and \$8.5 Billion was spent in FY22.

    -   The remaining \$2 Billion State CURE funds have been fully allocated and some have been spent already in FY23 (\$500 million transferred to General Revenue for "Lost Revenue" during COVID disruption, remaining dollars on programs and services).

## Other Revenue Graphs

Sankeyattempt2022.csv file totals \$32 billion flowing into the state. \$3.5 came in FY20, \$12 billion came in FY21 and \$16.1 billion in FY22.

These observations are based more on the IOC revenue data for revenue received instead of the covidmoneytracker.org data for revenue committed.

A little information on Sankey graphs is below:

-   The axis is how the observations are grouped at each step. There are multiple axes.
-   Strata are the options that exist for each level. (e.g. Year received can be 2021 or 2022)
-   Alluvium correspond to the fixed value of each axis variable. Proportional to how the sum of however you are grouping your data.
-   Flows are the segments of the alluvia between adjacent axes.
