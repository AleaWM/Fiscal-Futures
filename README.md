# Fiscal-Futures

Yearly files from the Illinois Comptroller are in the `revenue` and `expenditures` folders. 
These were acquired through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The files within these folders are before cleaning or recoding the data.

The revenue and expenditure files for each fiscal year are combined into files `allrev22.csv` and `allexp22.csv`. 
After the latest fiscal year ends and the data is received from the Comptroller, it is added to the `allrev` or `allexp` files.
These combined files are NOT to be used for summarizing or analyzing the State's finances because they have NOT been cleaned or recoded.
