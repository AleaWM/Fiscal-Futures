This is a living document in which we aim to describe things as clearly
as possible in the time we have, share it with others, and improve as we
come back to it. If we wait till we have time to write flawless docs,
it'll never happen.

Code and information on the analysis of Illinois' expenditures and
revenues. The Fiscal Future Project is associated with the Institute of
Government and Policy Affairs but publicly sharing the code and creating
a website was done by Alea Wilbur-Mujtaba. Any errors with code or
findings are the fault of the author, not the research institute. Data
originally from annual FOIA requests to the Illinois Office of the
Comptroller.

Budget}\label{including-or-excluding-funds-in-the-fiscal-futures-all-funds-budget}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Including or Excluding funds in the
Fiscal Futures All Funds Budget}

\markright{Including or Excluding funds in the Fiscal Futures All Funds
Budget}

While it is called an ``All Funds'' Budget, that is a slight
exaggeration. Illinois has over 700 funds. Whereas the overwhelming
majority are included in our ``All Funds'' measure, some are not.~ The
starting point for our list of all funds is all appropriated funds, but,
for the reasons listed below, we exclude a handful of appropriated funds
and include a number of non-appropriated funds.~

\textbf{Criterion 1:~INCLUDE IF the fund collects a state-levied tax.}

The state collects both state-levied taxes and locally levied taxes
(typically local-option sales and utility taxes).~ The state collects
and returns local taxes to the local governments.~ Upon receipt, local
tax revenues are deposited into specifically-designated,
non-appropriated state trust funds.~ In cases where the state is solely
acting as a collection agent for a local taxing body, this receiving
trust fund, its revenue and distribution (expenditure) is NOT counted in
our analytical frame.~ If the tax is collected for the state, the fund
and its revenue IS counted in our analytical frame.~

\textbf{Criterion 2:~ INCLUDE IF the fund supports a state function.}

Non-appropriated funds may support state functions such as education,
social services, transportation, public facilities, regulation, natural
resources, and law enforcement.~ Generally these are trust funds that
hold federal dollars for a specified state project or purpose.~ This
category of \emph{non-appropriated} funds is essentially the same as a
large group of \emph{appropriated} state and federal trust funds.~
Because we are counting federal dollars as revenue, it would be
inconsistent to count the appropriated funds, but not the
non-appropriated funds that do essentially the same thing.~

\textbf{Criterion 3:~ EXCLUDE IF the fund is a holding fund for
individuals.}

Many funds are used to hold monies that belong to individuals, not the
state.~ Most of these funds are non-appropriated, but some are
appropriated.~ Examples of appropriated funds that we exclude from the
frame are child support collection funds or employee pension
own-contribution funds.~ These funds are holding money that belongs to
an individual and will be returned to the person, or used for a payment
on behalf of that person, at a later date.~

\textbf{Criterion 4:~ EXCLUDE IF the fund's expenditures or revenues
have been counted elsewhere (i.e., avoid double-counting).}

In some cases, funds receive and disburse money that was already counted
as revenues to or expenditures from other funds.~ For example, the
Commercial Consolidation Fund is a huge fund that distributes state
benefit payments to individuals, service providers, and local
governments by direct deposit.~ Payments into this fund are counted,
distributions from this fund are not.~

\textbf{Criterion 5:~ EXCLUDE IF the fund holds designated user fees
targeted for a specific purpose that is not a public function
(conduit).}

Typically we have excluded non-appropriated funds that hold designated
user fees that are directed to a specific purpose that is not a
necessary public function.~ These funds can be considered a conduit and
we did not add these to the frame. ~For example, we exclude Fund 0098,
which collects fees from harness race entrants at the state fair and
then pays them out to race winners.

\textbf{Criterion 6:~ INCLUDE IF the fund collects a user fee that
supports a large, important state function (state function trumps user
fee).}

Non-appropriated funds that are supported by user fees AND perform a
state function (e.g., transportation) ARE counted in the frame.~ The
rationale for this is that the state function would have to be performed
even if the user fee and the fund structure did not exist.~ The biggest
example is the Illinois State Toll Highway Revenue Fund, which collects
tolls and supports the expansion and maintenance of Illinois toll
roads.~

\textbf{Criterion 7:~ EXCLUDE IF unclear information, dead fund, small
amounts.} Some funds are defunct, and our historical information on fund
descriptions does not include pre-2005 designations. Fund numbers are
re-used, making it impossible to determine the original purpose of some
older, defunct funds.~ These funds generally appear to be very small.~
Because we are projecting forward from the most recently completed
fiscal year, we assumed that these funds would not be in the frame.~

\hypertarget{sec-gathering-and-cleaning-data}{%
\chapter{Gathering and Cleaning
Data!}\label{sec-gathering-and-cleaning-data}}

Information for the Fiscal Futures all funds database comes from
detailed information provided by the Illinois Comptroller's office.~
Currently the database includes 300,000 individual records for fiscal
years 1998 to 2022.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do the FOIA request. In a week or so, they send the expenditure and
  revenue data as excel files.
\item
  Checks whether there are any new agencies, re-used funds etc. Create a
  list of funds, agencies, fund names, etc. for the new year and compare
  it to the immediate prior year to identify new funds.
\item
  Update the funds\_ab\_in file which shows the use of funds. Use
  criteria to determine if the new funds should be in or out of the
  all-funds frame.
\item
  Change the variable names to be consistent with other files such as
  AGENCYNAME -\/-\textgreater{} agency\_name
\item
  Once variable names are shared over all years of data, combine past
  years with newest year. All revenue files are in a `revenue` folder
  that I reference when I set the working directory. When adding new
  fiscal years, put the the newest year of data for revenue and
  expenditures in their respective folders.
\end{itemize}

Normally, when your receive the new fiscal year files from the
Comptrollers office, you will need to change the variable names so that
they are consistent with past years. This is an example of reading in
the new file and changing the variable names. They seem to change almost
every year in the file received from the FOIA so if the code breaks
here, check to make sure that the columns you are trying to rename exist
and are spelled correctly! Once variables are the same, you will want to
save the file as a csv file in its Revenue/Expenditure file and bind all
past years and the current year together in one dataframe.

The code chunk below takes the .dta files for all fiscal years before FY
2022 and binds them together. Variable names were manually changed by
past researchers so that they were consistent across years.

For FY 2023 and after, .dta files can be avoided entirely and .csv or
excel files will be used. All files before this year had been saved and
passed on as .dta files for Stata code before the transition to R in
Fall 2022. For years after fy22: add line of code to bind csv files
after binding the dta files together. Variable names must identical to
merge files together.

Code below reads in the csv files created in chunks above
(allrevfiles.csv and allrexpfiles.csv). These files contain all years of
data combined into one file BEFORE any recoding is done. Do not use this
file for summing categories because it is just an inbetween step before
recoding revenue and expenditure categories.

Data files for closed years have been obtained from IOC. The numbers of
funds, agencies, organizations, and revenue sources below were found by
using pivot tables in the codebook files in the FY2022 Box folder. This
could also be done using R and grouping new files by fund, agency,
source number, source names, etc..

Revenue File:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  684 Fund Numbers
\item
  80 Agencies
\item
  1184 Revenue source numbers
\item
  1156 revenue source names
\end{itemize}

Expenditure File:

\begin{itemize}

  708 Fund Numbers
\item
  107 Agencies
\item
  98 Organization Numbers
\item
  313 Organization names

General steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify new and reused funds for newest fiscal year.
\item
  Recode funds to take into account different fund numbers/names over
  the years. See {[}Recoding New and Reused Funds{]} for code chunk that
  does this.
\item
  Update fund\_ab\_in\_2022.xlsx with any changes from previous fiscal
  year.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{New Agencies, Funds, and Organizations from Expenditure files:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the code below, I found 2 agencies, multiple funds, and a couple
  organizations that had not been specifically mentioned in the
  funds\_ab\_in file - AWM, FY2022.
\item
  Note: One new org name and org number combo has an expenditure of
  \$600 million for pensions payment. Investigate later.

Sources 2737 through 2756 were not found in the IOC\_source file so I
added them to \texttt{ioc\_source\_updated22\_AWM.xlsx}. Revenue source
types were found manually using the Comptroller's website and searching
for each source listed above and identifying its type. Then the
ioc\_source excel file was updated to include the revenue type
(Completed Jan.~20 2023, AFTER the FY22 paper totals were calculated.
There were very minor differences in aggregated expenditures and
revenues.) \texttt{ioc\_source\_updated22\_AWM.xlsx} will become the
generic \texttt{ioc\_source.xlsx} file in the future.

\hypertarget{recoding-new-and-reused-funds}{%
\subsection{Recoding New and Reused
Funds}\label{recoding-new-and-reused-funds}}

New funds will need to be manually added to the funds\_ab\_in excel file
and determined if they should or should not be included in Fiscal Future
calculations.

For funds that were reused once, a 9 replaces the 0 as the first digit.
If reused twice, then the first two values are 10.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ex. 0350 -\/-\textgreater{} 9350 because its use changed.
\item
  Ex. 0367 becomes 10367 because its use has changed twice now. There
  was fund 0367 originally, then its use changed and it was recoded as
  9367, and now it changed again so it is a 10367.
\item
  Excel file also has alternative ways to name funds (e.g.~0397-A and
  0397-B) and variables for the year that the fund stopped being used.
  These have not been updated consistently over the years but it is
  useful information when trying to find any coding mistakes from the
  past.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Federal COVID Money Received}\label{sec-covid-federal-funds}}

Dropping revenue source ``Federal Stimulus Package'' from the IOC
revenue data is one way to start estimating how revenue will look after
the COVID relief ends. The graphs below show Illinois revenue with and
without Federal Stimulus Package revenue. It is important to note that
only the \$8.127 ARPA State CURE and \$3.519 CARES CRF/State CURE
revenue were labeled as ``Federal Stimulus Package'' in the IOC revenue
data. There was still an additional \$12 billion dollars in other
federal revenue that went to the state in FY22 compared to FY19. When
trying to understand the states finances and the yearly fiscal gap, we
also need to understand when and where the funds were considered revenue
in the IOC data and consider the fiscal year that the funds were spent.
Finally, allocations or expenditures may be grouped and labeled
differently by the State compared to the Fiscal Futures project
categorization. Some items that the federal relief funds are spent on
are not included in Fiscal Gap calculations (e.g.~the Unemployment
Insurance Trust Fund repayments). The biggest challenge when determining
the Fiscal Gap for Illinois centers around the timing of revenue and
expenditures occurring in different fiscal years during the COVID
response.

Read the charts from the top to the bottom. Most of the graphs below
begin with either the year the money was committed or the name of the
Law that provided the funds and then shows it flowing down to either who
received the money or how it was spent.

\texttt{Sankeyattempt2022.csv} file totals \$32 billion flowing into the
state. \$3.5 came in FY20, \$12.6 billion came in FY21 and \$16.1
billion in FY22. These values include both the State CURE and other
federal grants to state departments for education, health providers, and
much more. These observations are based more on the IOC revenue data for
revenue received.

Note: \$57 million in Federal Transportation dollars are grouped with
the billions of other federal revenue for simplified graphs and
summaries.

PPP \& Health Care Enhancement act contributed to \$2.778 billion for
Provider Relief Fund. This is considered within the Medicare category in
both revenues and expenditures.

Families First Act: \$4.469 billion for Medicaid (from Health and Human
Services and deposited into Healthcare Provider Relief fund; Data Source
IOC revenue data). This fund-revenue source combo grew from \$4 billion
in 2019, \$6 billion in 2020, \$7.5 billion in 2021 and \$8.4 billion
2022.

CARES \& ESSER impacts: Revenue from source ``Department of
Education-Fed'' and deposited into ``SBE Federal Dept of Education''.
Was \$1.45 billion in 2019 and 2020 and grew to \$2.26 billion in 2021
and \$3.35 billion in 2022.

\emph{Variable names in the sankeyattempt2022 file do not have the most
useful names due to the information within morphing over time as I
figured out the format to necessary for making the graphs. Any variable
names used while making these graphs might not actually contain the data
one would expect given the variable names. I do intend on renaming the
file and changing the variable names and code to something more
intuitive but have not had time to complete that task.}

\end{tcolorbox}

According to \href{covidmoneytracker.org}{federal data publicly
available}, \$52 billion has been committed to Illinois (including local
governments) but \$32 billion has been received by the state at the end
of Fiscal Year 2022 (as of June 30, 2022, excluding local governments).
An additional \$8.86 billion was committed straight to local
governments. More money has been received in FY23 but is not focused on
in this analysis. To see a graph of federal funds committed to the
State, jump to Section~\ref{sec-covid-money-tracker}.

Note: CARES funds were originally received and spent in Disaster
Response \& Recovery Fund. In FY22, unspent aid was transferred to the
State CURE and then transferred again to state agencies for
COVID-related expenditures. Remaining CARES funds were transferred to
State CURE fund for FY22. \$337 million was also transferred from the
Illinois Department of Revenue into the Illinois Housing Development
Authority (IHDA).

Federal expenditures from CURE and other major funds . Uses the

This data comes from Illinois Comptroller expenditure data, Legislative
Budget Oversight Commission (LBOC) Reports, and the
\href{https://budget.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/budget/documents/arpa/IL\%20Recovery\%20Plan\%20Performance\%20Report\%202022.pdf}{ARPA
Annual Recovery Plan} detailing the State's use of State and Local
Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) which is prepared by the Governor's Office
of Management and Budget (GOMB).

Dates on top are Fiscal Year received. Dates in the middle of the graph
are Fiscal Year expenditures. Remember, federal funds for COVID recovery
have been received and spent in different years.

Revenue from Local Cure is the Local Government Transfers. A small
amount of the State CURE was also transferred to local governments
(\$240 million in FY2021). There was also \$700 million ARPA State CURE
funds transferred to local governments during FY21 and FY22.

During fiscal years 2020 through 2022 \$11.03 billion (\$8.4 CURE +
\$3.082 ESSER) in State CURE and ESSER funds have been spent by the
state. An additional \$6.9 billion of grants from CARES, CRRSA, and ARPA
has been spent by state departments.

So far, over \$8.4 billion of the State CURE funds (includes both CARES
Act and ARP Act State Fiscal Recovery Fund) have been spent in
FY2020-2022.

\textbf{CARES State CURE money:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \$370 million was spent in the initial pandemic response in the very
  end of FY2020 and \$2.858 billion CARES dollars were spent in FY21.
\item
  In FY2022, almost all remaining CARES funds were used up
  (\textasciitilde250 million).
\item
  Around \$3.5 billion total spent during FY20-FY22.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ARPA State CURE money:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In FY22, \$4.9 billion (of \$8.127 billion received) ARPA-State CURE
  dollars were spent:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \$2.7 billion for repaying unemployment insurance trust fund, \$1
    billion transferred to the general revenue fund to make up for any
    lost revenue caused by the pandemic, and \$1.23 billion on other
    programs and services (e.g.~hospital stability payments, operational
    expenses, back to business grants and economic development).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Values presented in LBOC documents for the end of FY22 are slightly
different than the values calculated using IOC expenditure data. IOC
expenditure data includes all lag period expenditures through October so
values are slightly higher than end of June calculations.

Major uses of the State CURE funds include \$2.7 billion for repaying
the unemployment insurance trust fund deficit, \$1 billion was
transferred to general revenue to make up for lost revenue during the
pandemic, \$1.2 billion was transferred to multiple funds for
reimbursements of pandemic response related expenses, \$705 million for
Public Healthcare Providers (within Medicare), and over \$1.5 billion
has gone toward various forms of economic recovery and development.

Multiple billions of dollars of spending were funded with other federal
grants. For example, some CRRSA dollars were spent in FY22: \$1.1
billion ESSER II, \$332 million from a child care development block
grant, \$349 million for housing stability, and \$664 million for other
public health services like testing and contact tracing.

In FY21, \$1.8 billion from the CARES-State CURE went to operations and
grants for programs and services (e.g.~business interruptions, child
care grants, healthcare providers, rent/mortgage assistance, public
health response, etc.), \$1 billion was transferred to other Agencies
for reimbursing pandemic related costs, and \$569 million CARES-ESSER I
funds for K-12 education.

Approximately \$3.08 billion of the ESSER funds had been spent through
FY 2022 (of the \$7.88 billion received from ESSER I, II, and III
received) and in FY 2022 alone, the Illinois School Board for Education
received over \$5 billion from ARPA-ESSER III and spent under \$1
billion of it that fiscal year. These unspent funds do roll over to the
next fiscal year but must be used by 2024. Around \$4 billion remain.

According to the
\href{https://www.isbe.net/Pages/ESSER-Spending-Dashboard.aspx}{ISBE
Spending Dashboard} as of February 2, 2023, \$1.6 billion of ESSER II
and \$1.6 billion of ESSER III funds have been spent so far. ESSER I has
been nearly completely spent, ISBE has spent 79\% of its ESSER II
allocations and has spent 33\% of its ESSER III allocations.

\subsection{State CURE Expenditures with FY2023 and beyond
allocations}\label{state-cure-expenditures-with-fy2023-and-beyond-allocations}}

Graphs below include how money has been spent through FY22 with unspent
funds labeled as \texttt{FY2023+}. Only State CURE funds are included.
ESSER and other federal grants to state departments are excluded. Funds
may be used for expenses obligated through December 31, 2024 and
expended by December 31, 2026.

An additional \$254 million is expected to come to Illinois from the
Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund to be used for Connect Illinois
broadband projects (GOMB December 2022 LBOC report). This has been left
out of all graphs and summaries.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \$3.54 Billion received in FY20 for State Fiscal Recovery Fund (SFRF)+
  \$11.8 billion received in FY22 = \$15.3 billion total expenditures
  and allocations included in this image.
\item
  Around \$10.8 billion has gone into the State CURE fund (Coronavirus
  Relief Funds (CRF) and SFRF into the State CURE fund) and another
  \$4.5 billion was received by State Departments (mostly ISBE for K-12
  )
\item
  So far, over \$13 billion has been spent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \$2.7 billion was spent in FY21 and \$8.5 Billion was spent in FY22.
  \item
    The remaining \$2 Billion State CURE funds have been fully allocated
    and some have been spent already in FY23 (\$500 million transferred
    to General Revenue for ``Lost Revenue'' during COVID disruption,
    remaining dollars on programs and services).

\section{COVID Money Tracker Data - Dollars Committed To
Illinois}\label{sec-covid-money-tracker}}

Data was downloaded from COVIDMoneyTracker.org for the State of
Illinois. Values reflect the amount committed and not all funds have
been disbursed yet. It does not include aid for households or loans to
businesses. Data file is named federalcoviddollars.xlsx in Github page
used to create this website.

Pivot tables were made in Excel first and then code was written to make
the process easier to replicate.

If the only filter applied is State == Illinois, total Committed is over
\$152 billion.

Level 2 != Direct Payments (the stimulus checks)

Disbursement type != Loan or Aid to Individual

\subsection{Committed Totals - Including Local
Governments}\label{committed-totals---including-local-governments}}

The graphs below focus on when the money from each Federal Act arrived
and where it was received (local governments, the State government, or
directly to a state department) and the spending category that it would
be considered using the Fiscal Futures categorization. The State
government received \$11.7 billion, state departments received \$31.4
billion, and local governments received \$8.9 billion between FY 2020
and FY 2022. Not all funds have been distributed by the federal
government, but they have been committed on the federal level and
allocated on the state level.

The \$52 billion total includes Illinois state and local governments
(counties, cities, universities, and transit districts) and healthcare
providers in the state. Other forms of federal assistance are
\textbf{not} included in the totals or graphs (i.e.~stimulus checks,
unemployment insurance assistance for individuals, and the Paycheck
Protection Program are excluded from these totals). Summed values from
COVIDmoneytracker.org and LBOC December 2022 report match.

Legislation total funds (when including local government aid) were: ARPA
= \$25.6 Billion; CARES = \$15.7 Billion; Families First = \$4.5
Billion; PPP \& Health Care = \$2.8 Billion; Response \& Relief = \$3.4
Billion.

\includegraphics{./images/rev_CMT_52bil-01.png}

Local Governments within Illinois received \$8.9 billion for economic
recovery but we do not include funds given straight to localities in our
State COVID recovery fund calculations or Fiscal Gap analysis.

Additional labels were added using Publisher to create the image above.
Preliminary graphs and summed values for the image are calculated in the

Illinois received \$11.6 billion dollars from State Fiscal Recovery
Funds into its State CURE fund and also received \$31.4 billion in other
federal revenue to Illinois State departments. This other federal
revenue frequently came in the form of increased or new grants to many
State Departments that normally receive federal funding.

\subsection{Committed Totals - Excluding Local Government
Funds}\label{committed-totals---excluding-local-government-funds}}

Below is a graph showing federal stimulus money that was committed in
each year, the federal agency/fund that it came from, and what kind of
revenue it was considered (Federal Other, transportation, or medicaid)
who received the money (e.g.~the State of Illinois, Department of Human
Services, Local Governments, etc.). Again, these graphs show the funds
that were committed to Illinois and their intended purpose, NOT the data
on how or when it was spent.

When Local Funds are included, \$15.7 billion was received in FY20,
\$7.24 billion in FY21, and \$29 billion was received in FY22 from
multiple COVID response Federal Acts.

Around \$43 billion went to the state and \$8.8 billion went to straight
to local governments. When excluding the money that went straight to
local governments, the state received \$12.7 billion in FY20 (CARES
Act), \$7.24 billion in FY21, and \$23 billion was committed in FY22
(ARP Act). This includes both State CURE funds that had more flexibility
in how they were spent as well as the grants and that went to State
Departments for specific purposes.

The code below creates same graph as above but funds that went straight
to Local Governments (cities and counties) are dropped from the totals.

A little information on Sankey graphs is below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The axis is how the observations are grouped at each step. There are
  multiple axes.
\item
  Strata are the options that exist for each level. (e.g.~Year received
  can be 2021 or 2022)
\item
  Alluvium correspond to the fixed value of each axis variable.
  Proportional to how the sum of however you are grouping your data.
\item
  Flows are the segments of the alluvia between adjacent axes.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Local Transfers}\label{local-transfers}}

Separate transfers to local from parent agencies that come from DOR(492)
or Transportation (494). Treats muni revenue transfers as expenditures,
not negative revenue.

The share of certain taxes levied state-wide at a common rate and then
transferred to local governments. (Purely local-option taxes levied by
specific local governments with the state acting as collection agent are
NOT included.)

The six corresponding revenue items are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Local share of Personal Income Tax

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Individual Income Tax Pass-Through New 2021 (source 2582).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Local share of General Sales Tax
\item
  Personal Property Replacement Tax on Business Income
\item
  Personal Property Replacement Tax on Public Utilities
\item
  Local share of Motor Fuel Tax
\item
  Transportation Renewal Fund 0952
\end{itemize}

Until Dec 18. 2022, Local CURE was being aggregated into Revenue totals
since the agency was the Department of Revenue. However the \$371
million expenditure is for ``LOC GOVT ARPA'' and the revenue source that
is Local CURE is also \$371 million. Since it cancels out and is just
passed through the state government, I am changing changing the
fund\_ab\_in file so that in\_ff=0 for the Local CURE fund. It also
inflates the department of revenue expenditures in a misleading way when
the expense is actually a transfer to local governments.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dropping Local CURE fund from analysis results in a \$371 million
  decrease in the department of Revenue (where the Local Government ARPA
  transfer money). The appropriation for it was over \$740 million so
  some will probably be rolled over to FY23 too.
\item
  In the FY21 New and Reused Funds word document, 0325 Local CURE is
  described as \emph{``Created as a federal trust fund. The fund is
  established to receive transfers from either the disaster response and
  recovery fund or the state cure fund of federal funds received by the
  state. These transfers, subject to appropriation, will provide for the
  administration and payment of grants and expense reimbursements to
  units of local government. Revenues should be under Federal Other and
  expenditures under Commerce and Economic Opportunity.''} - Changed to
  Exclude.

Debt Service expenditures include interest payment on both short-term
and long-term debt. We do not include escrow or principal payments. Bond
proceeds are not considered a revenue for the state.

\textbf{Methodological Change, Sept.~30 2022:} We are no longer
including short term principal payments as a cost; only interest on
borrowing is a cost. Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an
escrow payment and principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as
revenues. This caused expenditures to be inflated because we were
essentially counting debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the
money was spent on in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect.

For additional context on bond proceeds coming in compared to the debt
service being paid, here is a very simple graph of all bond proceeds.
Bond proceeds are not considered a revenue source in the Fiscal Futures
model. We do not dive into the different types of proceeds but that
could be an interesting topic by itself.

A note on what is considered Transportation vs.~Tollway vs.~Capital
Projects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Transportation costs is made up of the road fund (0011) , capital
  administrative costs, and maintenance costs for the agency=494,
  Department of Transportation.
\item
  Tollway expenditures include maintenance and operation, principle and
  interest payments occurring from fund 0455 and agency = 577.
\item
  Capital improvement has a lot of projects that use bond financed funds
  for schools, sports facilities, etc. Agencies 511, 554, 574, and 598
  are coded together as group 946, capital improvement (Capital
  Development Board, Sports Facilities Development Authority, Metro Pier
  and Exposition Authority, and Upper River Development Authority which
  is no longer used). IOC uses object 8800.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Coding Notes: Filtering by Tollway agency 577 expenditures = SAME
as filtering by fund == 0455 expenditures}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Total Tollway expenditure = Debt service costs + maintenance \&
  operation costs
\end{itemize}

Principal and interest amounts calculated for the state exclude the
Illinois Tollway debt service and debt service for capital projects
(mostly because principal and interest are included as one item in the
data). Examples of capital projects include the IL Civic Center and
Build Illinois Bonds. Tollway principal and interest IS included in the
Illinois Tollway expenditures.

The object \texttt{tollway} includes all Tollway expenditures (capital
improvements, principal and interest payments, operations, etc).

\textbf{For yearly expenditure calculations, the state contributions to
the pension funds (object = 4431) should be the expenditure included for
pensions. If trying to look at the bigger fiscal health picture and
include unfunded liabilities and in/out flows, then items like purchase
of investments and POB spikes in trends that occurred from policy
changes should be analyzed and discussed in a separate section. Again,
State contributions TO the pension funds are the expenditures BUT an
additional graph/discussion on the employer contributions, employee
contributions, and benefits paid out should be included and considered
for additional context on Illinois' situation.}

Pension expenditures referenced in the analysis are based on state
payments to the following pension systems:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Teachers Retirement System (TRS)
\item
  New POB bond in 2019: Accelerated Bond Fund paid benefits in advance
  as lump sum
\item
  State Employee Retirement System (SERS)
\item
  State University Retirement System (SURS)
\item
  Judges Retirement System (JRS)
\item
  General Assembly Retirement System (GARS)
\end{itemize}

Employer contributions for pensions are excluded from analysis to avoid
double counting the cost of pensions. Expenditures with object 4430 for
pensions, benefits, and annuities appears in items from funds 0473,
0477, 0479, 0481, (TRS, JRS, SERS, GARS), 0755, 0786, 0787, 0788, 0789,
0799 (deferred compensation plan, GAR excess benefit, JRS excess
benefit, SER excess benefit, TRS excess benefit, state university
retirement system) are NOT included in the analysis. All are coded with
in\_ff=0 in the fund\_ab\_in.xlsx file of funds.

Most of these funds were found by either using CTRL-F with pension
related words or scrolling through code options on the comptroller's
website.

Pension contributions from employees and employers are not included as
revenue sources but are useful for understanding the money going into
the funds and the money flowing out of the funds. Identifying and
graphing employee and employer contributions, as well as benefits paid
to retired employees and state contributions was important for checking
the items that should and should not be included in the analysis.

\textbf{Additional pension info:}\\
For the \$10 billion in 2004, they borrowed money and invested it in
pension portfolio and hoped that the returns would be greater than the
interest on the debt. If returns\textgreater interest, then they
increased the pension funds and it was a good idea. Otherwise a short
term band-aid causes even more problems later. This added a significant
amount to the unfunded pension liabilities. In 2010 and 2011, POBs
served as a type of general borrowing for the state by borrowing against
what was owed to the pension systems and using that revenue that should
have funded pensions to instead subsidize the cost of providing core
services. Illinois borrowed money (POBs) and used it to pay for
government services. A temporary way to fill a budget gap for that 2010
that then costs more in the long run due to increased unfunded
liabilities and interest on the borrowed money. - ``Basket Case'' by Dye
2015 but summarized much more casually by Alea WM

In 2019 lawmakers offered a pension buyout plan where members could
opt-out of their future benefits for a lump sum. However, few people
participated in the buyout plan and very little savings have occurred so
far. The buyout plan has been extended to 2026 in hopes that more people
participate in it. Description of Pension Obligation Acceleration Bond
at this
\href{https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/003003300K7.7.htm}{link}.
Proceeds of bonds go into pension obligation acceleration fund (which
are not included as a revenue source) and the fund is only used to make
accelerated pension benefit payments. The pension stabilization fund
(0319) is money put into the pension funds to help pay for unfunded
liabilities from past poor budgeting decisions.

Discussion}\label{state-employee-healthcare-discussion}}

State Employee Health Care = Sum of expenditures for ``health care
coverage as elected by members per state employees group insurance
act.'' The payments are made from the Health Insurance Reserve Fund.
Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an
expenditure in our analysis.

Funding for the State Employees Group Insurance plan originates from two
funds. The Health Insurance Reserve Fund (HIRF) and the Group Insurance
Premium Fund (GIPF). Contributions and payment for Health coverage
benefits are deposited INTO HIRF and contributions for life insurance
are deposited into the GIPF.

HIRF is the fund mainly used to administer the group insurance program.
Funding for HIRF comes from several different revenue sources: the
General Revenue Fund (GRF), Road Fund, reimbursements, university funds,
and misc funds. Source:

In FY2013, the Local Government Health Insurance fund was transferred to
the department of Central Management Services (agency changes from 478
to 416 in data.)

Employer group insurance contributions for health insurance are excluded
to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare provision. All employer
group insurance contributions are coded as object = 1180. BUT the last
two fiscal years (FY21 and FY22) were coded as 1900 instead of 1180 for
lump sums instead of employer contributions. This caused an
\textasciitilde\$2 billion miscalculation when writing the FY21 paper
that was caught before publishing.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fund = 0907 = Health Insurance Reserve Fund, in\_ff = 1
\item
  Fund = 0457 is ``Group Insurance Premium Fund'', in\_ff = 1
\item
  Fund = 0193 is ``Local govt health insurance reserve'', in=ff = 0
\item
  fund = 0477 is ``Community College Health Insurance'', in=ff = 0.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    had large amount in early years
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fund = 9939 is ``group self-insurers' insolv'', in\_ff = 1
\item
  Fund = 0940 is Self-Insurers security, in\_ff = 0
\item
  Fund = 0739 is Group Workers Comp Pool Insol, in\_ff = 1

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    eehc = 0 means it is NOT a state healthcare cost but it is an
    employer contribution of some type to some fund
  \item
    eehc = 1 means it is a state employee healthcare cost and it is an
    employer contribution to health insurance
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If observation is a group insurance contribution, then the expenditure
amount is set to \$0 (essentially dropped from analysis).

\chapter{Federal Revenue}\label{federal-revenue}}

The Fiscal Futures Model divides federal funds (IOC revenue type = 57)
into Medicaid, Transportation, and All Other Federal Funds. ``All
Other'' federal revenue can include: Health and Human Services Grants,
Federal Stimulus Package, Department of Education Grants, Department of
Transportation Grants, Department of Agriculture Grants, TANF Grants,
and Department of Labor Grants.

\textbf{Federal Medicaid:} DHFS receives money for Medicaid that is
deposited into the General Revenue Fund. There are also Special State
Funds used for Medicaid that receive specific revenues (e.g.~Healthcare
Provider Taxes) which are matched with Federal Funds. The federal
receipts in these special funds are aggregated and added to the federal
receipts in the GRF that are received by DHFS.

\textbf{Revenue Sources:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  618 = Health and Human Services (not used)
\item
  660 = HHS/Hospital Participation
\item
  676 = Medical Assistance
\item
  692 = Medical Assistance
\item
  1552 = DHHS/ FFP-Medicaid Rehab Option
\item
  2306 = Enhanced Fed Fin PART-ARRA
\item
  2076 = IDPH-HHS/CMS
\item
  2364 = Department of Insurance (not used)
\item
  Revenue Source=1530 is labeled Medicaid Matching in IOC Sources list
  but it isn't used? 2140 is Matching Grant Monies but is also not used?
\item
  Other potential medicaid sources from CTRL-Fing ``med'' in revenue
  sources: Sources: 2104 = Medicare Part D \& 675 = Medical
  Administration
\end{itemize}

The Department of Healthcare and Family Services (DHFS) receives federal
monies for Medicaid that are deposited into the General Revenue Fund. In
addition, a number of special state funds are used for Medicaid. These
funds receive specific revenues --e.g., Healthcare Provider
Taxes---which are then matched with federal monies at approximately 50
percent. There are differences in the proportion of federal vs.~state
monies in the various funds, but the key is that there is a significant
federal component to the receipts in the funds. The federal receipts in
these special funds are aggregated and added to the federal receipts in
the GRF that are received by DHFS.

\textbf{Federal Transportation:} If Agency is 494 and considered Federal
Revenue, then it is recoded to its own category of ``Federal
Transportation''.

\textbf{Medicaid.}That portion of the Healthcare and Family Services (or
Public Aid in earlier years, agency code 478) budget for Medical
(appr\_organization code 65) for awards and grants (object codes 4400
and 4900).

\begin{quote}
State CURE revenue will remain in the Medicaid category due to the
nature of it being federal funds providing public health services and
funding to locations that provide public services.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Uses same appropriation name of ``HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELIEF'' and
  fund == 0793 and obj\_seq\_type == 49000000. So can defend the
  ``mistake'' of including healthcare provider relief as Medicaid
  expenditure.
\end{itemize}

Federal Medical Assistance Program (FMAP): in 1965. The FMAP formula
compares the state per-capita income to the national per-capita income.
There is no cap on the dollar amount that the federal government pays,
so the more that a state spends the more that it receives. a maximum of
83\%. States with a higher per-capita income receive lower FMAP funding
but no less than 50\%, and the states that have a lower per-capita
income receive higher FMAP funding. Those that need more, get more.

\subsection{State employee healthcare
costs}\label{state-employee-healthcare-costs}}

Coding healthcare costs was quite difficult. Over the years, State
employee healthcare has been within Central Management Bureau of
Benefits and Healthcare \& Family Services.

If observation is a group insurance contribution, then the expenditure
amount is set to \$0 (essentially dropped from analysis).

Agency 416 had group insurance contributions for 1998-2005 and
2013-present. Agency 478 had group insurance contributions from
2006-2012.

FY2021 and FY2022 contributions coded with object = 1900 (lump sum) for
some reason??

\subsection{Local Transfers}\label{local-transfers-1}}

Separate transfers to local from parent agencies that come from DOR(492)
or Transportation (494). Treats muni revenue transfers as expenditures,
not negative revenue.

The share of certain taxes levied state-wide at a common rate and then
transferred to local governments. (Purely local-option taxes levied by
specific local governments with the state acting as collection agent are
NOT included.)

The six corresponding revenue items are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Local share of Personal Income Tax

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Individual Income Tax Pass-Through New 2021 (source 2582).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Local share of General Sales Tax
\item
  Personal Property Replacement Tax on Business Income
\item
  Personal Property Replacement Tax on Public Utilities
\item
  Local share of Motor Fuel Tax - Transportation Renewal Fund 0952
\end{itemize}

Until Dec 18. 2022, Local CURE was being aggregated into Revenue totals
since the agency was the Department of Revenue. However the \$371
million expenditure is for ``LOC GOVT ARPA'' and the revenue source that
is Local CURE is also \$371 million. Since it cancels out and is just
passed through the state government, I am changing changing the
fund\_ab\_in file so that in\_ff=0 for the Local CURE fund. It also
inflates the department of revenue expenditures in a misleading way when
the expense is actually a transfer to local governments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dropping Local CURE fund from analysis results in a \$371 million
  decrease in the department of Revenue (where the Local Government ARPA
  transfer money). The appropriation for it was over \$740 million so
  some will probably be rolled over to FY23 too.\\
\item
  In the FY21 New and Reused Funds word document, 0325 Local CURE is
  described as \emph{``Created as a federal trust fund. The fund is
  established to receive transfers from either the disaster response and
  recovery fund or the state cure fund of federal funds received by the
  state. These transfers, subject to appropriation, will provide for the
  administration and payment of grants and expense reimbursements to
  units of local government. Revenues should be under Federal Other and
  expenditures under Commerce and Economic Opportunity.''} - I propose
  changing it to exclude for both.

The Local Transfers from the Personal Property Replacement Tax (fund
802) increased over \$2 billion from corporate income taxes alone.
Personal property replacement taxes (PPRT) are revenues collected by the
state of Illinois and paid to local governments to replace money that
was lost by local governments when their powers to impose personal
property taxes on corporations, partnerships, and other business
entities were taken away.

\hypertarget{debt-service}{%
\subsection{Debt Service}\label{debt-service}}

Debt Service expenditures include interest payment on both short-term
and long-term debt. We do not include escrow or principal payments.

\textbf{Decision from Sept 30 2022:} We are no longer including short
term principal payments as a cost; only interest on borrowing is a cost.
Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an escrow payment and
principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as revenues. This
caused expenditures to be inflated because we were essentially counting
debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the money was spent on
in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect.

State CURE will remain in the Medicaid expenditure category due to the

  Uses same appropriation name of ``HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELIEF'' and

\textbf{Dropping State CURE Revenue}

The Fiscal Futures model focuses on sustainable revenue sources. To
understand our fiscal gap and outlook, we need to exclude these one time
revenues. GOMB has emphasized that they have allocated COVID dollars to
one time expenditures (unemployment trust fund, budget stabilization
fund, etc.). The fiscal gap, graphs,and CAGRs have been recalculated in
the {[}Drop COVID Dollars{]} section below.

\begin{quote}
NOTE: The code chunk below only drops revenue sources with the source
name of ``Federal Stimulus Package'' (which is the State and Local CURE
revenue). Additional federal money went into other funds during the
beginning of pandemic. Many departments saw increased grants and
received other funds (e.g.~ESSER funds)

I chose to drop rev\_76 for Transfers in and Out because I do not
understand why that step occurs in the previously used Stata code.
Rev\_76 was created and included in rev\_78 for All Other Revenues in
old Stata code for years before FY21 but that method has been
discontinued for FY22. Including vs excluding rev\_76 does not change
the overall interpretation of the fiscal gap.

Since I already pivot\_wider()ed the table in the previous code chunk, I
now change each column's name by using rename() to set new variable
names. Ideally the final dataframe would have both the variable name and
the variable label but I have not done that yet.

Create total revenues and total expenditures only:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  after aggregating expenditures and revenues, pivoting wider, then I
  want to drop the columns that I no longer want and then
  pivot\_longer(). After pivoting\_longer() and creating
  \texttt{rev\_long} and \texttt{exp\_long}, expenditures and revenues
  are in the same format and can be combined together for the totals and
  gap each year.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sales Tax - online retailers}

\begin{quote}
Not edited or double checked. Just general notes pulled together while
looking into online sales tax.
\end{quote}

Law was passed in 2018 that required out of state retailers to pay the
6.25\% \textbf{state} sales tax. The Rebuild Illinois law expanded the
law to require remote retailers to charge all state and local retailers
occupation taxes beginning in July 1, 2020. Before Jan.~1 2021, only
state sales taxes were required to be collected (related to South Dakota
v Wayfair court decision). Now required to pay state \textbf{and local}
tax based on where product is delivered.

``On June 28, 2019, Public Act 101-0031, the''Leveling the Playing Field
for Illinois Retail Act,'' was signed into Illinois law and on December
13, 2019 an amendment to the Act was signed into law in Public Act
101-0604. In an effort to create more equity between remote sellers and
local brick-and-mortar retailers, the new law requires remote sellers
without a physical presence in the state and marketplace facilitators
(e.g., Amazon and Walmart) to collect both state and local sales taxes
effective January 1, 2021.''
\href{https://www.civicfed.org/civic-federation/blog/consumer-taxes-chicago-increases-and-updates-2021}{CivicFed.org}

Requires remote sellers and marketplace facilitators to collect and
remit the state and locally-imposed Retailers' Occupation Tax (ROT) for
the jurisdictions where the product is delivered (destination sourcing)
rather than collecting and remitting solely the state use tax.~

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  random note: Illinois' State sales tax rate is 6.25\%, of which 5.0\%
  of the sales tax revenue goes to the State, 1.0\% goes to all
  municipalities, including Chicago, and the remaining 0.25\% goes to
  the counties. However, Cook County's 0.25\% share of the State sales
  tax is distributed to the Regional Transportation Authority.
\end{itemize}

``The amended''Leveling the Playing Field for Illinois Retail Act'' was
passed by the General Assembly on November 14, 2019, to require both
Remote Retailers and Marketplace Facilitators to collect and remit the
state and locally-imposed Retailers' Occupation Tax (ROT, aka sales tax)
for the jurisdictions where the product is delivered (its destination)
starting January 1, 2021.''-
\href{https://www.iml.org/file.cfm?key=16124}{Illinois Municipal League}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Marketplace Facilitators, like Amazon, were required to collect Use
  Tax on sales starting January 1, 2020
\item
  Other sellers required to collect state and local sales tax on sales
  on January 2021.
\item
  There is a \textbf{state} tax rate of 6.25\% and Illinois
  municipalities may impose an additional \textbf{local} sales tax
  called the Retailer's Occupation Tax.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    For remote sellers, the state tax rate is referred to as ``use tax''
    and for intrastate sellers, ``ROT'' simply means \emph{sales tax}.~~
  \item
    The ROT is measured upon the seller's gross receipts and the seller
    is statutorily \uline{required} to collect the use tax from their
    customers.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  source 0482 is State ROT-2.2\%
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary Tables - Largest
Categories}\label{summary-tables---largest-categories}}

The 10 largest revenue sources and 13 largest expenditure sources remain
separate categories and all other smaller sources/expenditures are
combined into ``All Other \_\_\_\_\_''. These condensed tables are
typically used in the Fiscal Futures articles. They were manually
created in past years but this hopefully automates the process a bit
until final formatting stages.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  take ff\_rev and ff\_exp data frames, which were in wide format, pivot
  them longer and mutate the Category\_name variable to nicer labels.
  Keep largest categories separate and aggregate the rest.

\chapter{Dropping COVID State CURE
Dollars}\label{dropping-covid-state-cure-dollars}}

If only sustainable revenues are included in the model, then the federal
dollars from the pandemic response (CARES, CRSSA,\& ARPA)should be
excluded from the calculation of the fiscal gap.

The Fiscal Futures model focuses on sustainable revenue sources. To
understand our fiscal gap and outlook, we need to exclude these one time
revenues. GOMB has emphasized that they have allocated COVID dollars to
one time expenditures (unemployment trust fund, budget stabilization
fund, etc.). The fiscal gap, graphs,and CAGRs have been recalculated in
the {[}Drop COVID Dollars{]} section below.

\begin{quote}
NOTE: I have only dropped revenue with a source name =
\texttt{Federal\ Stimulus\ Package}. Federal money went into other funds
during the beginning of pandemic. All additional money for medicaid
reimbursements and healthcare provider funds were not considered
``Federal Stimulus Package'' in the data and were not dropped.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  fund 0628 is essential government support services. Money in the fund
  is appropriated to cover COVID-19 related expenses. It should be
  included in our frame based on criteria 2 and6 --- the fund supports
  an important state function about public safety, which would have to
  be performed even the fund structure were not existed. Public safety
  is supported by a combination of departments and boards, including IL
  Emergency Management Agency, which is the administering agency of the
  fund.

\section{Summary Tables - Largest
Categories}\label{summary-tables---largest-categories-1}}

The 10 largest revenue sources and 13 largest expenditure sources remain
separate categories and all other smaller sources/expenditures are
combined into ``All Other \_\_\_\_\_''. These condensed tables are
typically used in the Fiscal Futures articles. They were manually
created in past years but this hopefully automates the process a bit
until final formatting stages.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  take ff\_rev and ff\_exp data frames, which were in wide format, pivot
  them longer and mutate the Category\_name variable to nicer labels.
  Keep largest categories separate and aggregate the rest.
