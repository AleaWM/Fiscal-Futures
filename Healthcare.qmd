State Employee Health Care = Sum of expenditures for "health care coverage as elected by members per state employees group insurance act." The payments are made from the Health Insurance Reserve Fund. Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an expenditure in our analysis.

Funding for the State Employees Group Insurance plan originates from two funds. The Health Insurance Reserve Fund (HIRF) and the Group Insurance Premium Fund (GIPF). Contributions and payment for Health coverage benefits are deposited INTO HIRF and contributions for life insurance are deposited into the GIPF.

HIRF is the fund mainly used to administer the group insurance program. Funding for HIRF comes from several different revenue sources: the General Revenue Fund (GRF), Road Fund, reimbursements, university funds, and misc funds.

### **Coding details**

In FY2013, the Local Government Health Insurance fund was transferred to the department of Central Management Services (agency changes from 478 to 416 in data.)

Employer group insurance contributions for health insurance are excluded to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare provision. All employer group insurance contributions are coded as object = 1180. BUT the last two fiscal years (FY21 and FY22) were coded as 1900 instead of 1180 for lump sums instead of employer contributions. This caused an \~\$2 billion miscalculation when writing the FY21 paper that was caught before publishing.

-   Fund = 0907 = Health Insurance Reserve Fund, in_ff = 1
-   Fund = 0457 is "Group Insurance Premium Fund", in_ff = 1
-   Fund = 0193 is "Local govt health insurance reserve", in=ff = 0
-   fund = 0477 is "Community College Health Insurance", in=ff = 0.
    -   had large amount in early years
-   Fund = 9939 is "group self-insurers' insolv", in_ff = 1
-   Fund = 0940 is Self-Insurers security, in_ff = 0
-   Fund = 0739 is Group Workers Comp Pool Insol, in_ff = 1
    -   eehc = 0 means it is NOT a state healthcare cost but it is an employer contribution of some type to some fund

    -   eehc = 1 means it is a state employee healthcare cost and it is an employer contribution to health insurance

If observation is a group insurance contribution, then the expenditure amount is set to \$0 (essentially dropped from analysis).

### Health Insurance Premiums - Revenue Side

Employee insurance premiums for healthcare are a revenue source for the state in the IOC data but are NOT included in the Fiscal Futures analysis as a revenue or in fiscal gap calculations.

Source \#'s:

-   0120 = ins prem-option life
-   0120 = ins prem-optional life/univ
-   0347 = optional health - HMO
-   0348 = optional health - dental
-   0349 = optional health - univ/local SI
-   0350 = optional health - univ/local
-   0351 = optional health - retirement
-   0352 = optional health - retirement SI
-   0353 = optional health - retire/dental
-   0354 = optional health - retirement hmo
-   2199-2209 = various HMOs, dental, health plans from Health Insurance Reserve (fund)

```{r employee-insurance-premiums}

health_insurance_fund_rev<- rev_temp %>% 
  filter(fund=="0907") %>% # everything that goes to fund 0907
    group_by(fy) %>%

After removing a few of those lines, we are left with the overall cost providing healthcare and the total amount of money that flows into the Health Insurance Fund.
