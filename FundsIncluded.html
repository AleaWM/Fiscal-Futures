<p>While it is called an “All Funds” Budget, that is a slight exaggeration. Illinois has over 700 funds. Whereas the overwhelming majority are included in our “All Funds” measure, some are not.&nbsp; The starting point for our list of all funds is all appropriated funds, but, for the reasons listed below, we exclude a handful of appropriated funds and include a number of non-appropriated funds.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preliminary expenditure and revenue data is requested after the Fiscal Year ends, and the requested again at the end of the lapse period.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Calculations are based off the values received from the data received after October 31st when Illinois’ lapse period ends.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 1:&nbsp;INCLUDE IF the fund collects a state-levied tax.</strong></p>
<p>The state collects both state-levied taxes and locally levied taxes (typically local-option sales and utility taxes).&nbsp; The state collects and returns local taxes to the local governments.&nbsp; Upon receipt, local tax revenues are deposited into specifically-designated, non-appropriated state trust funds.&nbsp; In cases where the state is solely acting as a collection agent for a local taxing body, this receiving trust fund, its revenue and distribution (expenditure) is NOT counted in our analytical frame.&nbsp; If the tax is collected for the state, the fund and its revenue IS counted in our analytical frame.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 2:&nbsp; INCLUDE IF the fund supports a state function.</strong></p>
<p>Non-appropriated funds may support state functions such as education, social services, transportation, public facilities, regulation, natural resources, and law enforcement.&nbsp; Generally these are trust funds that hold federal dollars for a specified state project or purpose.&nbsp; This category of <em>non-appropriated</em> funds is essentially the same as a large group of <em>appropriated</em> state and federal trust funds.&nbsp; Because we are counting federal dollars as revenue, it would be inconsistent to count the appropriated funds, but not the non-appropriated funds that do essentially the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 3:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF the fund is a holding fund for individuals.</strong></p>
<p>Many funds are used to hold monies that belong to individuals, not the state.&nbsp; Most of these funds are non-appropriated, but some are appropriated.&nbsp; Examples of appropriated funds that we exclude from the frame are child support collection funds or employee pension own-contribution funds.&nbsp; These funds are holding money that belongs to an individual and will be returned to the person, or used for a payment on behalf of that person, at a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 4:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF the fund’s expenditures or revenues have been counted elsewhere (i.e., avoid double-counting).</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, funds receive and disburse money that was already counted as revenues to or expenditures from other funds.&nbsp; For example, the Commercial Consolidation Fund is a huge fund that distributes state benefit payments to individuals, service providers, and local governments by direct deposit.&nbsp; Payments into this fund are counted, distributions from this fund are not.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 5:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF the fund holds designated user fees targeted for a specific purpose that is not a public function (conduit).</strong></p>
<p>Typically we have excluded non-appropriated funds that hold designated user fees that are directed to a specific purpose that is not a necessary public function.&nbsp; These funds can be considered a conduit and we did not add these to the frame. &nbsp;For example, we exclude Fund 0098, which collects fees from harness race entrants at the state fair and then pays them out to race winners.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 6:&nbsp; INCLUDE IF the fund collects a user fee that supports a large, important state function (state function trumps user fee).</strong></p>
<p>Non-appropriated funds that are supported by user fees AND perform a state function (e.g., transportation) ARE counted in the frame.&nbsp; The rationale for this is that the state function would have to be performed even if the user fee and the fund structure did not exist.&nbsp; The biggest example is the Illinois State Toll Highway Revenue Fund, which collects tolls and supports the expansion and maintenance of Illinois toll roads.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criterion 7:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF unclear information, dead fund, small amounts.</strong> Some funds are defunct, and our historical information on fund descriptions does not include pre-2005 designations. Fund numbers are re-used, making it impossible to determine the original purpose of some older, defunct funds.&nbsp; These funds generally appear to be very small.&nbsp; Because we are projecting forward from the most recently completed fiscal year, we assumed that these funds would not be in the frame.&nbsp;</p>

<span id="cb2-21"><a href="#cb2-21" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While it is called an "All Funds" Budget, that is a slight exaggeration. Illinois has over 700 funds. Whereas the overwhelming majority are included in our "All Funds" measure, some are not.&nbsp; The starting point for our list of all funds is all appropriated funds, but, for the reasons listed below, we exclude a handful of appropriated funds and include a number of non-appropriated funds.<span class="ot">[^fundsincluded-1]</span>&nbsp;</span>

<span id="cb2-40"><a href="#cb2-40" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-41"><a href="#cb2-41" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The state collects both state-levied taxes and locally levied taxes (typically local-option sales and utility taxes).&nbsp; The state collects and returns local taxes to the local governments.&nbsp; Upon receipt, local tax revenues are deposited into specifically-designated, non-appropriated state trust funds.&nbsp; In cases where the state is solely acting as a collection agent for a local taxing body, this receiving trust fund, its revenue and distribution (expenditure) is NOT counted in our analytical frame.&nbsp; If the tax is collected for the state, the fund and its revenue IS counted in our analytical frame.&nbsp;</span>
<span id="cb2-42"><a href="#cb2-42" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-43"><a href="#cb2-43" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Criterion 2:&nbsp; INCLUDE IF the fund supports a state function.**</span>
<span id="cb2-44"><a href="#cb2-44" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-45"><a href="#cb2-45" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Non-appropriated funds may support state functions such as education, social services, transportation, public facilities, regulation, natural resources, and law enforcement.&nbsp; Generally these are trust funds that hold federal dollars for a specified state project or purpose.&nbsp; This category of *non-appropriated* funds is essentially the same as a large group of *appropriated* state and federal trust funds.&nbsp; Because we are counting federal dollars as revenue, it would be inconsistent to count the appropriated funds, but not the non-appropriated funds that do essentially the same thing.&nbsp;</span>
<span id="cb2-46"><a href="#cb2-46" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-47"><a href="#cb2-47" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Criterion 3:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF the fund is a holding fund for individuals.**</span>
<span id="cb2-48"><a href="#cb2-48" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-49"><a href="#cb2-49" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Many funds are used to hold monies that belong to individuals, not the state.&nbsp; Most of these funds are non-appropriated, but some are appropriated.&nbsp; Examples of appropriated funds that we exclude from the frame are child support collection funds or employee pension own-contribution funds.&nbsp; These funds are holding money that belongs to an individual and will be returned to the person, or used for a payment on behalf of that person, at a later date.&nbsp;</span>
<span id="cb2-50"><a href="#cb2-50" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-51"><a href="#cb2-51" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Criterion 4:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF the fund's expenditures or revenues have been counted elsewhere (i.e., avoid double-counting).**</span>
<span id="cb2-52"><a href="#cb2-52" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-53"><a href="#cb2-53" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In some cases, funds receive and disburse money that was already counted as revenues to or expenditures from other funds.&nbsp; For example, the Commercial Consolidation Fund is a huge fund that distributes state benefit payments to individuals, service providers, and local governments by direct deposit.&nbsp; Payments into this fund are counted, distributions from this fund are not.&nbsp;</span>
<span id="cb2-54"><a href="#cb2-54" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-55"><a href="#cb2-55" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Criterion 5:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF the fund holds designated user fees targeted for a specific purpose that is not a public function (conduit).**</span>
<span id="cb2-56"><a href="#cb2-56" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-57"><a href="#cb2-57" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Typically we have excluded non-appropriated funds that hold designated user fees that are directed to a specific purpose that is not a necessary public function.&nbsp; These funds can be considered a conduit and we did not add these to the frame. &nbsp;For example, we exclude Fund 0098, which collects fees from harness race entrants at the state fair and then pays them out to race winners.</span>
<span id="cb2-58"><a href="#cb2-58" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-59"><a href="#cb2-59" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Criterion 6:&nbsp; INCLUDE IF the fund collects a user fee that supports a large, important state function (state function trumps user fee).**</span>
<span id="cb2-60"><a href="#cb2-60" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-61"><a href="#cb2-61" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Non-appropriated funds that are supported by user fees AND perform a state function (e.g., transportation) ARE counted in the frame.&nbsp; The rationale for this is that the state function would have to be performed even if the user fee and the fund structure did not exist.&nbsp; The biggest example is the Illinois State Toll Highway Revenue Fund, which collects tolls and supports the expansion and maintenance of Illinois toll roads.&nbsp;</span>
<span id="cb2-62"><a href="#cb2-62" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-63"><a href="#cb2-63" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Criterion 7:&nbsp; EXCLUDE IF unclear information, dead fund, small amounts.** Some funds are defunct, and our historical information on fund descriptions does not include pre-2005 designations. Fund numbers are re-used, making it impossible to determine the original purpose of some older, defunct funds.&nbsp; These funds generally appear to be very small.&nbsp; Because we are projecting forward from the most recently completed fiscal year, we assumed that these funds would not be in the frame.&nbsp;</span>
