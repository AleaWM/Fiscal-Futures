    "text": "Background Information\nWhile the main purpose of this site is documenting methodology used in the Fiscal Futures Annual Report, it also contains useful information on Illinois budget variables used by the Illinois Office of the Comptroller (IOC) that may be valuable to other researchers. Frequently discussed topics (e.g. Pensions, Debt, Federal Revenue Sources, Medicaid, etc.) each have their own section on this site dedicated to looking at the many relevant variables for that topic, even if the budget variables are not directly included while calculating the Fiscal Gap for the Fiscal Futures Annual Report.\nThis website was originally created by Alea Wilbur-Mujtaba as an internal document for Fiscal Futures researchers to increase reproducibility and update the methodology documentation used for the Fiscal Futures Annual Report. Until August 2022, The FF Annual Report was calculated using Stata code and documentation that had been passed on for years and modified in a piece-meal fashion. AWM translated the Stata files into a very long Rmarkdown file before transitioning to a Github Page with downloadable public data. She also created the method for comparing funds/agencies/revenue sources in current and past fiscal years, identified the important data values and code relevant for various fiscal topics, and coded all files associated with creating this website. The methodology for selecting funds to include in the Fiscal Gap calculation and tracking them over time was created by David Merriman and Richard Dye and updated with the help of many PhD researchers since 2008.\nNote from Alea Wilbur-Mujtaba: This document is a good faith effort to increase reproducibility and transparency for both the Fiscal Futures Annual Report and Illinois budget data as a whole. I recognized that the time and effort spent on identifying variables and graphing fiscal topics could be valuable to other researchers and took the initiative to create this page and repository from the documents I inherited as an IGPA Research Assistant. This endeavor has had a sharp learning curve and I could easily have made mistakes along the way. This is a working document and small edits are made to the site frequently. I intend to document major changes with new repository releases.\nYou can read the FY22 Fiscal Futures Annual Report here: Recovering from a (COVID) Spending Fever\nTo learn more about the history of the Fiscal Futures Project and read past reports, please visit The Fiscal Futures webpage. The Fiscal Future Project is one of many research projects within the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA)."

    "text": "Github Data Notes and Organization\nThe authors and IGPA believe that these novel datasets will be valuable to other researchers interested in Illinois’ finances.\n\nOriginal files as they were received from FOIA requests is in the data/DATA_RAW folder. The version of the files used in the analysis and to create this website are in the data/DATA_DTA folder. The files within these folders are before cleaning or recoding the data. Most of the files for individual years are saved as .dta files due to using Stata before FY21.\nallexp_fy23_recoded.csv and allrev_fy23_recoded are probably the best for any researchers trying to use this data in their own projects.\n\nCleanest version of data before aggregating totals or dropping observations not included in the Fiscal Futures fiscal gap calculation. All years in one file. Funds and agencies should have numbers and consistent labels. Includes the “Group” variable used in the FF Annual Report used for calculating expenditures by function. To do: Add group names to go with group number code. Done after pivoting and merging in normal Fiscal Gap calculation code.\nCreated in February 2023. Still checking accuracy. AWM made this version of the data specifically for other researchers. The normal work flow for the Annual Report involves dropping observations gradually while cleaning and coding the data. Significant changes to the code used for the Annual Report were made to create a new dataset that attempts to keep all Illinois budget observations that have been consistently coded over time with the additional descriptive variables used by Fiscal Futures researchers. Again, I cannot gurantee the accuracy of this file but the original data and code for cleaning the data is available to get you started.\n\n\nexp_temp and rev_temp\n\nUsed in fiscal gap calculation. Data is cleaned and coded up to the point right before aggregating category totals. Drops observations we do not keep in fiscal gap calculation.\n\nA summary file containing aggregated yearly expenditure and revenue values for categories used in the Fiscal Futures model can be found in the summary_file_FY2023.xlsx excel file. This excel file also contains additional tabs for all CAGR values calculated as well as the yearly change between the most recent fiscal year and the previous fiscal year. All tables included in the Annual Report are in the summary file.\nThe Annual Report is part of Fiscal Futures project associated with the University of Illinois System Institute of Government and Policy Affairs (IGPA). Creating the R code, Github folder, and website for methodology was done by Alea Wilbur-Mujtaba. Any errors with code or findings are the fault of the author, not the research institute. Data is originally from annual FOIA requests to the Illinois Office of the Comptroller."

    "section": "1.1 Including or Excluding funds in the Fiscal Futures All Funds Budget",
    "text": "1.1 Including or Excluding funds in the Fiscal Futures All Funds Budget\nWhile it is called an “All Funds” Budget, that is a slight exaggeration. Illinois has over 700 funds. Whereas the overwhelming majority are included in our “All Funds” measure, some are not.  The starting point for our list of all funds is all appropriated funds, but, for the reasons listed below, we exclude a handful of appropriated funds and include a number of non-appropriated funds.1 \nPreliminary expenditure and revenue data is requested after the Fiscal Year ends, and the requested again at the end of the lapse period.2 Calculations are based off the values received from the data received after October 31st when Illinois’ lapse period ends.\nCriterion 1: INCLUDE IF the fund collects a state-levied tax.\nThe state collects both state-levied taxes and locally levied taxes (typically local-option sales and utility taxes).  The state collects and returns local taxes to the local governments.  Upon receipt, local tax revenues are deposited into specifically-designated, non-appropriated state trust funds.  In cases where the state is solely acting as a collection agent for a local taxing body, this receiving trust fund, its revenue and distribution (expenditure) is NOT counted in our analytical frame.  If the tax is collected for the state, the fund and its revenue IS counted in our analytical frame. \nCriterion 2:  INCLUDE IF the fund supports a state function.\nNon-appropriated funds may support state functions such as education, social services, transportation, public facilities, regulation, natural resources, and law enforcement.  Generally these are trust funds that hold federal dollars for a specified state project or purpose.  This category of non-appropriated funds is essentially the same as a large group of appropriated state and federal trust funds.  Because we are counting federal dollars as revenue, it would be inconsistent to count the appropriated funds, but not the non-appropriated funds that do essentially the same thing. \nCriterion 3:  EXCLUDE IF the fund is a holding fund for individuals.\nMany funds are used to hold monies that belong to individuals, not the state.  Most of these funds are non-appropriated, but some are appropriated.  Examples of appropriated funds that we exclude from the frame are child support collection funds or employee pension own-contribution funds.  These funds are holding money that belongs to an individual and will be returned to the person, or used for a payment on behalf of that person, at a later date. \nCriterion 4:  EXCLUDE IF the fund’s expenditures or revenues have been counted elsewhere (i.e., avoid double-counting).\nIn some cases, funds receive and disburse money that was already counted as revenues to or expenditures from other funds.  For example, the Commercial Consolidation Fund is a huge fund that distributes state benefit payments to individuals, service providers, and local governments by direct deposit.  Payments into this fund are counted, distributions from this fund are not. \nCriterion 5:  EXCLUDE IF the fund holds designated user fees targeted for a specific purpose that is not a public function (conduit).\nTypically we have excluded non-appropriated funds that hold designated user fees that are directed to a specific purpose that is not a necessary public function.  These funds can be considered a conduit and we did not add these to the frame.  For example, we exclude Fund 0098, which collects fees from harness race entrants at the state fair and then pays them out to race winners.\nCriterion 6:  INCLUDE IF the fund collects a user fee that supports a large, important state function (state function trumps user fee).\nNon-appropriated funds that are supported by user fees AND perform a state function (e.g., transportation) ARE counted in the frame.  The rationale for this is that the state function would have to be performed even if the user fee and the fund structure did not exist.  The biggest example is the Illinois State Toll Highway Revenue Fund, which collects tolls and supports the expansion and maintenance of Illinois toll roads. \nCriterion 7:  EXCLUDE IF unclear information, dead fund, small amounts. Some funds are defunct, and our historical information on fund descriptions does not include pre-2005 designations. Fund numbers are re-used, making it impossible to determine the original purpose of some older, defunct funds.  These funds generally appear to be very small.  Because we are projecting forward from the most recently completed fiscal year, we assumed that these funds would not be in the frame."

    "text": "Information for the Fiscal Futures all funds database comes from detailed information provided by the Illinois Comptroller’s office.  Currently the database includes 300,000 individual records for fiscal years 1998 to 2022.\n\nDo the FOIA request. In a week or so, they send the expenditure and revenue data as excel files.\nChecks whether there are any new agencies, re-used funds etc. Create a list of funds, agencies, fund names, etc. for the new year and compare it to the immediate prior year to identify new funds.\nUpdate the funds_ab_in file which shows the use of funds. Use criteria to determine if the new funds should be in or out of the all-funds frame.\nChange the variable names to be consistent with other files such as AGENCYNAME --&gt; agency_name\nOnce variable names are shared over all years of data, combine past years with newest year. All revenue files are in a `revenue` folder that I reference when I set the working directory. When adding new fiscal years, put the the newest year of data for revenue and expenditures in their respective folders.\n\nNormally, when your receive the new fiscal year files from the Comptrollers office, you will need to change the variable names so that they are consistent with past years. This is an example of reading in the new file and changing the variable names. They seem to change almost every year in the file received from the FOIA so if the code breaks here, check to make sure that the columns you are trying to rename exist and are spelled correctly! Once variables are the same, you will want to save the file as a csv file in its Revenue/Expenditure file and bind all past years and the current year together in one dataframe.\n\n#Example code below: Read in excel file and rename columns so that it plays well with the other years' files.\n\nrevenue_fy23 &lt;- read_xlsx(\"Fis_Fut_Rev_2023_Final.xlsx\") %&gt;% \n  rename(fy = 'FY',\n         fund = 'FUND',\n         fund_name = 'FUND NAME',\n         agency = 'AGENCY',\n         agency_name = 'AGENCY NAME',\n         source = 'REVENUE SOURCE',\n         source_name = 'REV SRC NAME',\n         receipts = 'AMOUNT'\n  ) \n\nexp_fy23 &lt;- read_xlsx(\"Fis_Fut_Exp_2023_Final.xlsx\") %&gt;% \n  rename(fy = 'FY',\n         fund = 'FUND',\n         fund_name = 'FUND NAME',\n         agency = 'AGENCY',\n         agency_name = 'AGENCY NAME',\n         appr_org = 'ORGANIZATION',\n         org_name = 'ORGANIZATION NAME',\n         obj_seq_type = 'APPROPRIATION',\n         wh_approp_name = 'APPROPRIATION NAME',\n        # exp_net_xfer = 'NET OF TRANS AMOUNT',\n         expenditure = 'EXPENDED'\n\n  ) \n\n# %&gt;%\n#   # these come from ioc_source file after merging\n#   mutate(data_source = \"exp IOC Aug 2022\",\n#          object = ,\n#          seq = ,\n#          type = ,\n#          fund_cat = FIND_COLUMN, #create fund_cat column\n#          fund_cat_name = FIND_NAME) # create fund_cat_name column\n\nThe code chunk below takes the .dta files for all fiscal years before FY 2022 and binds them together. Variable names were manually changed by past researchers so that they were consistent across years.\nFor FY 2023 and after, .dta files can be avoided entirely and .csv or excel files will be used. All files before this year had been saved and passed on as .dta files for Stata code before the transition to R in Fall 2022.\n\nFor years after fy22: add line of code to bind csv files after binding the dta files together. Variable names must be identical to merge files together.\n\nCode below reads in the csv files created in chunks above (allrevfiles.csv and allrexpfiles.csv). These files contain all years of data combined into one file BEFORE any recoding is done. Do not use this file for summing categories because it is just an inbetween step before recoding revenue and expenditure categories. It also does not contain changes in funds or agencies.\n\n\nCode\n# combined in past chunks called create-rev-csv and create-exp-csv\n\nallrevfiles23 &lt;- read_csv(\"./data/allrevfiles_Nov132023.csv\") #combined but not recoded\n\nallexpfiles23 &lt;- read_csv(\"./data/allexpfiles_Nov132023.csv\") #combined but not recoded\n\n\n\n2.0.1 Inspecting new FY23 data files\nData files for closed years have been obtained from IOC. The numbers of funds, agencies, organizations, and revenue sources below were found by using pivot tables in the codebook files in the FY2022 Box folder.

Variables were renamed when needed to have consistent names but funds and agencies have NOT been recoded for consistency in these files.\n\n\nNew or reused funds were manually added to the funds_ab_in.xlsx file and determined if they should or should not be included in Fiscal Future calculations.\nFor funds that were reused once, a 9 replaces the 0 as the first digit. If reused twice, then the first two values are 10.\n\nEx. 0350 --&gt; 9350 because its use changed.\nEx. 0367 becomes 10367 because its use has changed twice now. There was fund 0367 originally, then its use changed and it was recoded as 9367, and now it changed again so it is a 10367.\nExcel file also has alternative ways to name funds (e.g. 0397-A and 0397-B) and variables for the year that the fund stopped being used. These have not been updated consistently over the years but it is useful information when trying to find any coding mistakes from the past.\n\nNew or reused funds revenue file recoding:\n\n# if first character is a 0, replace with a 9 if its purpose has changed\n\nrev_1998_2023 &lt;- allrevfiles23 %&gt;%\n\n      mutate(fund = ifelse(fy &lt;

    "text": "3.1 Comptroller Revenue Data\nRead the charts from the top to the bottom. Most of the graphs below begin with either the year the money was committed or the name of the Law that provided the funds and then shows it flowing down to either who received the money or how it was spent.\nSankey2023.csv file totals $32 billion flowing into the state. $3.5 came in FY20, $12.6 billion came in FY21 and $16.1 billion in FY22. These values include both the State CURE and other federal grants to state departments for education, health providers, and much more. These observations are based more on the IOC revenue data for revenue received.\nNote: $57 million in Federal Transportation dollars are grouped with the billions of other federal revenue for simplified graphs and summaries.\nPPP & Health Care Enhancement act contributed to $2.778 billion for Provider Relief Fund. This is considered within the Medicare category in both revenues and expenditures.\nFamilies First Act: $4.469 billion for Medicaid (from Health and Human Services and deposited into Healthcare Provider Relief fund; Data Source IOC revenue data). This fund-revenue source combo grew from $4 billion in 2019, $6 billion in 2020, $7.5 billion in 2021 and $8.4 billion 2022.\nCARES & ESSER impacts: Revenue from source “Department of Education-Fed” and deposited into “SBE Federal Dept of Education”. Was $1.45 billion in 2019 and 2020 and grew to $2.26 billion in 2021 and $3.35 billion in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVariable names in the sankeyattempt2022 file do not have the most useful names due to the information within morphing over time as I figured out the format to necessary for making the graphs. Any variable names used while making these graphs might not actually contain the data one would expect given the variable names. I do intend on renaming the file and changing the variable names and code to something more intuitive but have not had time to complete that task.\n\n\nAccording to federal data publicly available, $52 billion has been committed to Illinois (including local governments) but $32 billion has been received by the state at the end of Fiscal Year 2022 (as of June 30, 2022, excluding local governments). An additional $8.86 billion was committed straight to local governments. More money has been received in FY23 but is not focused on in this analysis.

Uses the fedCUREexpenditures.xlsx file.\nThis data comes from Illinois Comptroller expenditure data, Legislative Budget Oversight Commission (LBOC) Reports, and the ARPA Annual Recovery Plan detailing the State’s use of State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) which is prepared by the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget (GOMB).\nDates on top are Fiscal Year received. Dates in the middle of the graph are Fiscal Year expenditures. Remember, federal funds for COVID recovery have been received and spent in different years.\nRevenue from Local Cure is the Local Government Transfers. A small amount of the State CURE was also transferred to local governments ($240 million in FY2021). There was also $700 million ARPA State CURE funds transferred to local governments during FY21 and FY22.\n\n3.2.1 Fiscal Years 2020-2023\nDuring fiscal years 2020 through 2023 $11.03 billion ($8.4 CURE + $3.4266 ESSER) in State CURE and ESSER funds have been spent by the state. An additional $6.9 billion of grants from CARES, CRRSA, and ARPA has been spent by state departments.\nOver $9 billion of State CURE funds (includes both CARES Act and ARP Act State Fiscal Recovery Fund) was received in in FY2020-2023 (nearly all of it in FY 2022).\n\n3.2.1.1 CURE Dollars\n\nAs of FY23, $6.648 billion of the $9 billion received has been spent. 2.352 billion allocated for the future in FY24 +\n\n\nRemember: All revenue was recieved in FY22 and the Fiscal Futures model ignores Statutory Transfers to the Fiscal Gap will look negative in FY22 (i.e. it looks “good”) and the gap will be positive in FY23 and beyond (i.e. it looks “bad” because expenses &gt; revenues when ignoring transfers).\n\nCARES State CURE money:\n\n$370 million was spent in the initial pandemic response in the very end of FY2020 and $2.858 billion CARES dollars were spent in FY21.\nIn FY2022, almost all remaining CARES funds were used up (~250 million).\nAround $3.5 billion total spent during FY20-FY22.\n\nARPA State CURE money:\n\nIn FY22, $4.9 billion (of $8.127 billion received) ARPA-State CURE dollars were spent:\n\n$2.7 billion for repaying unemployment insurance trust fund, $1 billion transferred to the general revenue fund to make up for any lost revenue caused by the pandemic (aka “Essential Government Services”), and $1.23 billion on other programs and services (e.g. hospital stability payments, operational expenses, back to business grants and economic development).\n\nIn FY23, $2.47 billion spent:\n\n1.36 billion for UI Trust fund repayment, and $1.1 billion on additional areas: $212 million for nursing home financial assistance, $150 million for affordable housing grants, plus many more\n\nAs of the end of FY23, $8.01 billion of State CURE funds have been spent\n\nValues presented in LBOC documents for the end of FY22 are slightly different than the values calculated using IOC expenditure data. IOC expenditure data includes all lag period expenditures through October so values are slightly higher than end of June calculations.\nK-12 Spending and ESSER Money\n\n$3.4266 billion Total spent through FY23 from ARP and ESSER Funds. - 1.694 billion spent in 2023 (ARP = ESSER III) but that money arrived in 2022 (=&gt; Fiscal Gap Implications!)\n\n\n$2.34 Billion of ARP Emergency Relief Funds (aka ESSER III) spent in 2022 and 2023 combined\n583 million for ESSER II in 2021\n376 million with ESSER I in 2021 and 128 million in 2020.\nISBE received around an additional $7.9 billion total from ESSER compared to its normal federal funding because of COVID\nAt end of State’s FY23, $3.43/$7.9 billion = ~ 50% spent\nAs of Dec.7th, it has spent 74.1% of these funds (“ESSER Spending Dashboard” 2023)\n640 million allocated for FY24 (according to CPS, I think they have fiscal years though…)\n\n\ncure_exp &lt;- read_xlsx(\"./data/fedCUREexpenditures.xlsx\")\n\n\ncure_exp2023 &lt;- cure_exp %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n         FY_Spent = factor(FY_Spent, levels = c(\"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\", \"2023\")),\n         FY_Received = factor(FY_Received, levels = c(\"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\", \"2023\")))\n\n\ncure_exp2023 %&gt;% #expenditures per year\n  filter(State_local == \"State CURE\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`FY_Spent`)%&gt;% \n  summarize(Expenditures=sum(`FY Expenditures`))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# State CURE expenditures only\ncure_exp2023%&gt;%  \n    filter(State_local == \"State CURE\") %&gt;%\n  summarize(Expenditures=sum(`FY Expenditures`)) \n\n\n\n  \n\n\ncure_exp2023 %&gt;% \n  filter(State_local == \"State CURE\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Law, FF_Cat2)%&gt;% \n  summarize(Expenditures=sum(`FY Expenditures`)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Law, values_from = Expenditures)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode chunk below is for State CURE funds spent through FY 2022.\n\n\nCode\n# State CURE only, \n# without 2023 allocations\n\ncure_exp2023  %&gt;% \n  filter(State_local == \"State CURE\") %&gt;% # for only state CURE funds\n  ggplot(aes(y = `FY Expenditures`, axis4 = FY_Received, axis3 = `Agency`,  \n             axis2 = FY_Spent, axis1=FF_Cat2, label = \"stratum\")) +\n  geom_flow(aes(fill = FF_Cat2), color = \"black\", reverse=FALSE) +\n  geom_stratum(reverse=FALSE)+\n  coord_flip()+\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = -1)+\n  theme_void() + \n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")+\n  \n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2, reverse=FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Expenditures using State CURE funds: $8.4 spent FY20-FY22\", \n  subtitle = \"Year Received by State Department, Year Spent, and how it was spent so far\", \n  caption = \"Expenditures occured during FY20, FY21 and FY22. \n       Additional funds have been allocated for FY23 and can be spent until FY26.\n  Public Health & Public Safety combined due to overlap with IEMA's involvemnt in pandemic response.\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## State CURE only\n# through FY23\ncure_exp2023  %&gt;% \n  filter(State_local == \"State CURE\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = `FY Expenditures`, axis3 = `State_local2`, axis2 = Agency_grouped, axis1=FF_Cat2, label = \"stratum\"))+\n  geom_flow(aes(fill = Law), color = \"black\", reverse=FALSE) +\n  geom_stratum(reverse=FALSE)+\n coord_flip()+\n   scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = -1)+\n  theme_void() + \n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")+\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2, reverse=FALSE) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")+\n\n  labs(title = \"State CURE Expenditures: Department that Received Revenue\n       & Purpose of Expenditure\",\n       subtitle = \"$8.4 billion spent by end of FY22\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncure_exp2023 %&gt;% #expenditures for State government (with CURE $) and state departments\n  group_by(State_local2)%&gt;% \n  summarize(Expenditures=sum(`FY Expenditures`))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\n# State CURE & ESSER grants\ncure_exp2023 %&gt;% # total expenditures \n  summarize(Expenditures=sum(`FY Expenditures`)) \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMajor uses of the State CURE funds include $2.7 billion for repaying the unemployment insurance trust fund deficit, $1 billion was transferred to general revenue to make up for lost revenue during the pandemic, $1.2 billion was transferred to multiple funds for reimbursements of pandemic response related expenses, $705 million for Public Healthcare Providers (within Medicare), and over $1.5 billion has gone toward various forms of economic recovery and development.\nMultiple billions of dollars of spending were funded with other federal grants.

The State government received $11.7 billion, state departments received $31.4 billion, and local governments received $8.9 billion between FY 2020 and FY 2022. Not all funds have been distributed by the federal government, but they have been committed on the federal level and allocated on the state level.\nThe $52 billion total includes Illinois state and local governments (counties, cities, universities, and transit districts) and healthcare providers in the state. Other forms of federal assistance are not included in the totals or graphs (i.e. stimulus checks, unemployment insurance assistance for individuals, and the Paycheck Protection Program are excluded from these totals). Summed values from COVIDmoneytracker.org and LBOC December 2022 report match.\nLegislation total funds (when including local government aid) were: ARPA = $25.6 Billion; CARES = $15.7 Billion; Families First = $4.5 Billion; PPP & Health Care = $2.8 Billion; Response & Relief = $3.4 Billion.\n\n\nOld image - Federal Transportation amount is incorrect and should be part of Local Transfers.\n\n\n\nLocal Governments within Illinois received $8.9 billion for economic recovery but we do not include funds given straight to localities in our State COVID recovery fund calculations or Fiscal Gap analysis.\nAdditional labels were added using Publisher to create the image above.

This other federal revenue frequently came in the form of increased or new grants to many State Departments that normally receive federal funding.\n\n\n3.4.2 Committed Totals - Excluding Local Government Funds\nBelow is a graph showing federal stimulus money that was committed in each year, the federal agency/fund that it came from, and what kind of revenue it was considered (Federal Other, transportation, or medicaid) who received the money (e.g. the State of Illinois, Department of Human Services, Local Governments, etc.). Again, these graphs show the funds that were committed to Illinois and their intended purpose, NOT the data on how or when it was spent.\nWhen Local Funds are included, $15.7 billion was received in FY20, $7.24 billion in FY21, and $29 billion was received in FY22 from multiple COVID response Federal Acts.\nAround $43 billion went to the state and $8.8 billion went to straight to local governments. When excluding the money that went straight to local governments, the state received $12.7 billion in FY20 (CARES Act), $7.24 billion in FY21, and $23 billion was committed in FY22 (ARP Act). This includes both State CURE funds that had more flexibility in how they were spent as well as the grants and that went to State Departments for specific purposes.\nThe code below creates same graph as above but funds that went straight to Local Governments (cities and counties) are dropped from the totals.\n\nsankey %&gt;% \n  filter(FF_Cat2!= \"Excluded\") %&gt;%\n\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Dollars Received`, axis3 = FY, axis2 = `Broad Category`, axis1=FF_Cat2, label = \"stratum\")) +\n  geom_flow(aes(fill = Legislation), color = \"black\", reverse=FALSE) +\n # guides(fill = FALSE) +   \n  geom_stratum(reverse=FALSE)+\ncoord_flip()+\n   scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = -1)+\n  theme_void() +\n     geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2, reverse=FALSE)+\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Without Local government relief:\n          $12.7 Billion in FY20, $7 Billion in FY21, and $23 Billion in FY22 Committed to Illinois\")\n\n\n\nsankey %&gt;% filter(FF_Cat2!= \"Excluded\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = `Dollars Received`, axis4 = FY, axis3= `Category`,  axis1=FF_Cat2\n          # , label = \"stratum\"\n           )) +\n  geom_flow(aes(fill = Legislation, label = \"flow\"), \n            color = \"black\", reverse=FALSE) +\n # guides(fill = FALSE) +   \n  geom_stratum(reverse=FALSE)+\n     geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), \n               size = 3, reverse=FALSE)+\n  coord_flip()+\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = -1)+\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.title=element_blank())+\n  ggtitle(\"Without Local government relief:\n          $12.7 Billion in FY20, $7.3 Billion in FY21, and $21.5 Billion in FY22 Committed to Illinois\")\n\n\n\n# without local government CURE funds\nsankey %&gt;% \n  filter(FF_Cat2 != \"Excluded\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(FY)%&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(FY)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(Legislation)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(Recipient)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(FF_Cat)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(Legislation, Recipient)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = Legislation, values_from = TotalReceived)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(Legislation, FF_Cat)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = Legislation, values_from = TotalReceived)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(FY, FF_Cat)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = FY, values_from = TotalReceived)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(Legislation, FF_Cat2)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = Legislation, values_from = TotalReceived)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsankey %&gt;% group_by(FY, FF_Cat2)%&gt;%summarize(TotalReceived=sum(`Dollars Received`)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = FY, values_from = TotalReceived)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n3.4.2.1 Notes on Sankey Graphs\nggsankey info and example\n\nA little information on Sankey graphs is below:\n\nThe axis is how the observations are grouped at each step.

    "text": "Separate transfers to local from parent agencies that come from DOR(492) or Transportation (494). Treats muni revenue transfers as expenditures, not negative revenue.\nThe share of certain taxes levied state-wide at a common rate and then transferred to local governments. (Purely local-option taxes levied by specific local governments with the state acting as collection agent are NOT included.)\nThe six corresponding revenue items are:\n\nLocal share of Personal Income Tax\n\nIndividual Income Tax Pass-Through New 2021 (source 2582).\n\nLocal share of General Sales Tax\nPersonal Property Replacement Tax on Business Income\nPersonal Property Replacement Tax on Public Utilities\nLocal share of Motor Fuel Tax\nTransportation Renewal Fund 0952\n\nUntil Dec 18. 2022, Local CURE was being aggregated into Revenue totals since the agency was the Department of Revenue. However the $371 million expenditure is for “LOC GOVT ARPA” and the revenue source that is Local CURE is also $371 million. Since it cancels out and is just passed through the state government, I am changing changing the fund_ab_in file so that in_ff=0 for the Local CURE fund. It also inflates the department of revenue expenditures in a misleading way when the expense is actually a transfer to local governments.\n\nDropping Local CURE fund from analysis results in a $371 million decrease in the department of Revenue (where the Local Government ARPA transfer money). The appropriation for it was over $740 million so some will probably be rolled over to FY23 too.\nIn the FY21 New and Reused Funds word document, 0325 Local CURE is described as “Created as a federal trust fund. The fund is established to receive transfers from either the disaster response and recovery fund or the state cure fund of federal funds received by the state.

IOC uses object 8800.\n\nCoding Notes: Filtering by Tollway agency 577 expenditures = SAME as filtering by fund == 0455 expenditures\n\nTotal Tollway expenditure = Debt service costs + maintenance & operation costs\n\nPrincipal and interest amounts calculated for the state exclude the Illinois Tollway debt service and debt service for capital projects (mostly because principal and interest are included as one item in the data). Examples of capital projects include the IL Civic Center and Build Illinois Bonds.

    "text": "State Employee Health Care = Sum of expenditures for “health care coverage as elected by members per state employees group insurance act.” The payments are made from the Health Insurance Reserve Fund. Employee contributions are not considered a revenue source or an expenditure in our analysis.\nFunding for the State Employees Group Insurance plan originates from two funds. The Health Insurance Reserve Fund (HIRF) and the Group Insurance Premium Fund (GIPF). Contributions and payment for Health coverage benefits are deposited INTO HIRF and contributions for life insurance are deposited into the GIPF.\nHIRF is the fund mainly used to administer the group insurance program. Funding for HIRF comes from several different revenue sources: the General Revenue Fund (GRF), Road Fund, reimbursements, university funds, and misc funds. Source: CGFA Report.\n\n7.0.1 Coding details\nIn FY2013, the Local Government Health Insurance fund was transferred to the department of Central Management Services (agency changes from 478 to 416 in data.)\nEmployer group insurance contributions for health insurance are excluded to avoid double counting the cost of healthcare provision. All employer group insurance contributions are coded as object = 1180.

In addition, a number of special state funds are used for Medicaid. These funds receive specific revenues –e.g., Healthcare Provider Taxes—which are then matched with federal monies at approximately 50 percent. There are differences in the proportion of federal vs. state monies in the various funds, but the key is that there is a significant federal component to the receipts in the funds. The federal receipts in these special funds are aggregated and added to the federal receipts in the GRF that are received by DHFS.\nFederal Transportation: If Agency is 494 and considered Federal Revenue, then it is recoded to its own category of “Federal Transportation”.\nFederal revenue broken down into Transportation, Medicaid, and Other:\n\n\nCode\nrev_temp &lt;- rev_temp %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type==\"57\" & agency==\"478\" & (source==\"0618\"|source==\"2364\"|source==\"0660\"|source==\"1552\"| source==\"2306\"| source==\"2076\"|source==\"0676\"|source==\"0692\"), \"58\", rev_type),\n    rev_type_name = ifelse(rev_type==\"58\", \"Federal Medicaid Reimbursements\", rev_type_name),\n    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type==\"57\" & agency==\"494\", \"59\", rev_type),\n    rev_type_name = ifelse(rev_type==\"59\", \"Federal Transportation\", rev_type_name),\n    rev_type_name = ifelse(rev_type==\"57\", \"Federal - Other\", rev_type_name),\n    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type==\"6\", \"06\", rev_type),\n    rev_type = ifelse(rev_type==\"9\", \"09\", rev_type)) \n\nrev_temp %&gt;% \n  filter(rev_type == \"58\" | rev_type == \"59\" | rev_type == \"57\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(fy, rev_type, rev_type_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)/1000000) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=fy, y=receipts,color=rev_type_name)) +\n    geom_recessions(xformay = \"numeric\",text = FALSE)+\n\n  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=receipts,color=rev_type_name)) +\n      theme_classic() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+\n  labs(title = \"Federal to State Transfers\", \n       caption = \"These values include stimulus funds after the Great Recession and the COVID pandemic response.\",\n       y = \"Millions of Dollars\", x = \"\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.title = element_blank()  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrev_temp %&gt;% \n  filter(rev_type == \"58\" | rev_type == \"59\" | rev_type == \"57\") %&gt;% \n  filter(source_name_AWM != \"FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE\" & source_name_AWM != \"STATE CURE\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(fy, rev_type, rev_type_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)/1000000) %&gt;% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=receipts,color=rev_type_name)) +\n      theme_classic() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+\n  labs(title = \"Federal to State Transfers\", \n       caption = \"These values include stimulus funds after the Great Recession and the COVID pandemic response.\",\n       y = \"Millions of Dollars\", x = \"\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.title = element_blank()  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll federal revenue summed together:\n\n\nCode\nfedrev&lt;- rev_temp %&gt;% \n  filter(rev_type == \"58\" | rev_type == \"59\" | rev_type == \"57\") \n\nfedrev %&gt;% \n  group_by(fy) %&gt;% \n  summarise(receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)/1000000) %&gt;% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=receipts)) +\n      theme_classic() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+\n  labs(title = \"All Federal Revenue\", \n       y = \"Millions of Dollars\", x = \"\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.title = element_blank()  )+\n    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,45000))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfedrev %&gt;% \n  filter(source_name_AWM != \"FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(fy) %&gt;% \n  summarise(receipts = sum(receipts, na.rm = TRUE)/1000000) %&gt;% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x=fy, y=receipts)) +\n      theme_classic() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+\n  labs(title = \"All Federal EXCEPT Federal Stimulus Package\", \n       y = \"Millions of Dollars\", x = \"\",\n       caption = \"Note: Dropping Federal Stimulus Package revenue only removes the $3.5 billion from FY20, $0.3 billion from FY21, and \n       $8.5 billion from FY22.

Treats muni revenue transfers as expenditures, not negative revenue.\nThe share of certain taxes levied state-wide at a common rate and then transferred to local governments. (Purely local-option taxes levied by specific local governments with the state acting as collection agent are NOT included.)\nThe six corresponding revenue items are:\n\nLocal share of Personal Income Tax\n\nIndividual Income Tax Pass-Through New 2021 (source 2582).\n\nLocal share of General Sales Tax\nPersonal Property Replacement Tax on Business Income\nPersonal Property Replacement Tax on Public Utilities\nLocal share of Motor Fuel Tax\nTransportation Renewal Fund 0952\n\nUntil Dec 18. 2022, Local CURE was being aggregated into Revenue totals since the agency was the Department of Revenue. However the $371 million expenditure is for “LOC GOVT ARPA” and the revenue source that is Local CURE is also $371 million. Since it cancels out and is just passed through the state government, I am changing changing the fund_ab_in file so that in_ff=0 for the Local CURE fund. It also inflates the department of revenue expenditures in a misleading way when the expense is actually a transfer to local governments.\n\nDropping Local CURE fund from analysis results in a $371 million decrease in the department of Revenue (where the Local Government ARPA transfer money). The appropriation for it was over $740 million so some will probably be rolled over to FY23 too.\n\nIn the FY21 New and Reused Funds word document, 0325 Local CURE is described as “Created as a federal trust fund. The fund is established to receive transfers from either the disaster response and recovery fund or the state cure fund of federal funds received by the state. These transfers, subject to appropriation, will provide for the administration and payment of grants and expense reimbursements to units of local government. Revenues should be under Federal Other and expenditures under Commerce and Economic Opportunity.” - I propose changing it to exclude for both.\n\n\n\nCode\nexp_temp &lt;- exp_temp %&gt;% mutate(\n  agency = case_when(fund==\"0515\" & object==\"4470\" & type==\"08\" ~ \"971\", # income tax to local governments\n                     fund==\"0515\" & object==\"4491\" & type==\"08\" & sequence==\"00\" ~ \"971\", # object is shared revenue payments\n                     fund==\"0802\" & object==\"4491\" ~ \"972\", #pprt transfer\n                     fund==\"0515\" & object==\"4491\" & type==\"08\" & sequence==\"01\" ~ \"976\", #gst to local\n                     fund==\"0627\" & object==\"4472\"~ \"976\" , # public transportation fund but no observations exist\n                     fund==\"0648\" & object==\"4472\" ~ \"976\", # downstate public transportation, but doesn't exist\n                     fund==\"0515\" & object==\"4470\" & type==\"00\" ~ \"976\", # object 4470 is grants to local governments\n                    object==\"4491\" & (fund==\"0188\"|fund==\"0189\") ~ \"976\",\n                     fund==\"0187\" & object==\"4470\" ~ \"976\",\n                     fund==\"0186\" & object==\"4470\" ~ \"976\",\n                    object==\"4491\" & (fund==\"0413\"|fund==\"0414\"|fund==\"0415\")  ~ \"975\", #mft to local\n                  fund == \"0952\"~ \"975\", # Added Sept 29 2022 AWM.

We do not include escrow or principal payments.\nDecision from Sept 30 2022: We are no longer including short term principal payments as a cost; only interest on borrowing is a cost. Pre FY22 and the FY21 correction, we did include an escrow payment and principle payments as costs but not bond proceeds as revenues. This caused expenditures to be inflated because we were essentially counting debt twice - the principle payment and whatever the money was spent on in other expenditure categories, which was incorrect.\n\n\nCode\ndebt_drop &lt;- exp_temp %&gt;% \n  filter(object == \"8841\" |  object == \"8811\")  \n# escrow  OR  principle\n\n#debt_drop %&gt;% group_by(fy) %&gt;% summarize(sum = sum(expenditure)) %&gt;% arrange(-fy)\n\n\ndebt_keep &lt;- exp_temp %&gt;% \n  filter(fund != \"0455\" & (object == \"8813\" | object == \"8800\" )) \n# examine the debt costs we want to include\n\n#debt_keep %&gt;% group_by(fy) %&gt;% summarize(sum = sum(expenditure)) %&gt;% arrange(-fy) \n\n\nexp_temp &lt;- anti_join(exp_temp, debt_drop) \nexp_temp &lt;- anti_join(exp_temp, debt_keep)\n\ndebt_keep &lt;- debt_keep %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    agency = ifelse(fund != \"0455\" & (object == \"8813\" | object == \"8800\"), \"903\", as.character(agency)),\n    group = ifelse(fund != \"0455\" & (object == \"8813\" | object == \"8800\"), \"903\", as.character(group)),\n    in_ff = ifelse(group == \"903\", 1, as.character(in_ff)))\n\ndebt_keep_yearly &lt;- debt_keep %&gt;% group_by(fy, group) %&gt;% summarize(debt_cost = sum(expenditure,na.rm=TRUE)/1000000) %&gt;% select(-group)\n\n\n\n\n11.1.7 Medicaid\nMedicaid. That portion of the Healthcare and Family Services (or Public Aid in earlier years, agency code 478) budget for Medical (appr_organization code 65) for awards and grants (object codes 4400 and 4900).\n\nState CURE will remain in the Medicaid expenditure category due to the nature of it being federal funds providing public health services and funding to locations that provide public services.\n\n\nUses same appropriation name of “HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELIEF” and fund == 0793 and obj_seq_type == 49000000.

To understand our fiscal gap and outlook, we need to exclude these one time revenues. GOMB has emphasized that they have allocated COVID dollars to one time expenditures (unemployment trust fund, budget stabilization fund, etc.). The fiscal gap, graphs,and CAGRs have been recalculated in the [Drop COVID Dollars] section below.\n\nNOTE: The code chunk below only drops revenue sources with the source name of “Federal Stimulus Package” (which is the State and Local CURE revenue). Additional federal money went into other funds during the beginning of pandemic. Many departments saw increased grants and received other funds (e.g. funds)\n\n\n\nCode\nrev_temp &lt;- rev_temp %&gt;% mutate(covid_dollars = ifelse(source_name_AWM == \"FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE\",1,0))\n\nrev_temp %&gt;% filter(source_name_AWM == \"FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(fy) %&gt;% summarize(Received = sum(receipts))\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Health Insurance Premiums from Employees\nInsurance premiums for employees is coded below but it is NOT used in the fiscal futures model.
